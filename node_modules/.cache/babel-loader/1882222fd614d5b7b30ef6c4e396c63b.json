Tel. 617-267-0336</p>\n            <p>\"I have graduated medicine in Bulgaria. The need to improve my education led me to the reading of psychoanalytic literature. The ideas of Karen Horney can be applied in different countries, and her introduction of self-analysis as a supporting method would significantly facilitate the training of psychoanalysts from the former East European countries. Reading her essays strongly influenced my wish to specialize in psychiatry in the U.S. I came to this country recently and am now in the process of preparing for the exams necessary for getting into a residency. I shall be glad to contact analysts whose work is based on Horney's ideas. At present I live in Boston and would like to meet analysts working in this region. I am also available for international communication. I speak French, English, some German, and, as a Bulgarian, I am fluent in Russian. In East European countries there is still a considerable deficit regarding psychoanalytic literature. I would be glad to help with the translation and publishing of Horney's works abroad.\"</p>\n          </v-card>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Eric W.

Her account of the masochist's seemingly excessive suffering as an attempt to dissolve the boundaries of the self is helpful in explaining the controversial ending of Bellow's novel. I am working on a Ph.D. in English at the University of Florida and I also plan on training as an analyst. I would be interested in learning about psychoanalytic institutes around the world that are open to the training of lay analysts and use the ideas of Horney and Erich Fromm as guiding theories.\"</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Arnaldo Apolito, M.D.</v-card-title>\n                <br />\n                <p>(U. of Naples)</p>\n                <p>80 Undercliff Road, Montclair, NJ 07042.

She was my faculty advisor and a key person in my development as a person and as a psychoanalyst. She was indeed a great lady and I thoroughly enjoyed putting together the commemorative issue of The American Journal of Psychoanalysis (Fall, 1991) and the Conference to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of her founding of the Institute, the Association, and the seeds for the Karen Horney Clinic (see the 1955 Karen Horney Foundation Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 1, which I edited).\"</p>\n                <p>The proceeding of the above mentioned conference have been published as Women Beyond Freud: New Concepts of Feminine Psychology, ed.

As my analyst trained in New York with a Horneyan institute, I became interested in Horney's work. I have become active in the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, and I have presented papers to the Academy on the negative therapeutic reaction, the stories of Hans Christian Andersen, and the mythology of vampires. I have a private practice in psychiatry and psychoanalysis and teach part-time in a psychiatric residency.

Institutional affiliations: University of Chicago, De Paul University, Northwestern University (Institute for Learning in Retirement).</p>\n                <p>\"Karen Horney is unique among psychoanalysts because she has written at length about the feasibility and desirability of self-analysis. I believe that I have gained an insight into this process that is both profound and unique, in part because I am not a psychological professional. I have earned my livelihood as a lawyer. I am interested in how self-analysis has benefitted me and can benefit others who are similarly endowed and needy.</p>\n                <p>What I call 'psychoanalytic literacy' is analogous to language literacy. A person who know how to read and write has been given a technique for self-improvement that has been in the forefront of advancing civilization and has begun a journey that lasts his whole life. So it can be with psychoanalytic literacy. Just as language literacy required a long period of development to arrive at the role it now plays in civilization, so it is probable that the same is the destiny of psychoanalysis. Today barely a century old, it is an idea before its time. We can only conjecture as to how long it will take to fulfill its destiny. But it appears evident to me that the IKHS can provide an opportunity for advancing the cause, and that is why it pleases me to become a member.\"</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Bettee F.

A general exploration of the common ground between Horney and the work of George Kelly in his Psychology of Personal Constructs--specifically the contributions they both made in helping us to understand what it means to have a profound interest in the nature of an adult unconscious which cannot be reduced to a set of infantile concerns.\"</p>\n          </v-card>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">James Fadiman, Ph.D.</v-card-title>\n                <br />\n                <p>(Stanford)</p>\n                <p>1070 Colby Ave., Menlo Park, CA 94025.

I am interested in the meaning of this concept from various perspectives--such as the personal meanings it held for Horney herself, the development of its meanings and theoretical role in her theories, its uses in her therapeutic approach. I explore also Horney's development of the meanings of the experienced real self or of being oneself--for instance, of wholeheartedness, of being in the present moment--and the relation of this development to her interest in Zen. My work examines connections between the evolutionary process of the idea of the real self and Karen Horney's creative process in working out her philosophy, theories, concepts, and therapeutic approach. Another focus of my interest is how the development and underpinnings of Horney's later work are related to her early work in feminine psychology.\"</p>\n                <P>Work address: Women's Psychotherapy Centre of Wisconsin, 16 N.

Because Horney explains so many of us, and because the data relevant to character structure is more readily accessible than data on sexual functioning, etc., such works are often greeted as more 'balanced' than most psychobiographies. But because the analysis often strikes so close to home for many of us, it is sometimes blatantly misinterpreted and dismissed as 'psycho-baloney.'\"</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Robin Steier Goldberg, Ph.D.</v-card-title>\n                <br />\n                <p>(Clinical Psychology, Fordham U)</p>\n                <p>1349 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10128.

Americans for the most part have lived in a threatening environment and have responded both individually and collectively with a clear search for glory, formation of idealized selves, and most often an expansive strategy for coping with life. The book traces this pattern in popular culture from movies to comic strips, in politics from Presidents to popular votes, in cultural institutions such as religion and business, and in history from the revolution to the present. Examples of individuals (such as Kennedy and Johnson in politics, Kirk Douglas and Marilyn Monroe in film) and of groups (such as the Mormons and political and economic bureaucracies), as well as historical and cultural trends, are used to support the basic argument.\"</p>\n                <p>Recent essay: \"A Horneyan Approach to American Literature,\" in Dionysus in Literature: Essays on Literary Madness, ed.

I have published several papers using Horney to interpret conflicts in characters (The Journal of Evolutionary Psychology), and I have introduced Horney to the audience at several conferences. My particular interest--and I would be very happy to hear from anyone working in this area--is to study the application of non-Freudian psychoanalytic theory to female writers. I have found in my extensive work on Edith Wharton that many feminists deplore Freud but see no practical alternatives for psychological criticism.

Some of the strategies she has described can be seen as pseudo adaptations to the power struggles and control battles that go on within the family. Since competition is in the air we breathe but conflicts with the value we place on highly affiliative relationships, the struggle to evolve a system to deconstruct unhealthy competitive mindsets is an important one. Moving away from highly competitive positions has the reward of richer and closer connections both within ourselves and between ourselves and others. I should be delighted to hear from any interested people with views on this subject.\"</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n            <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Jeffrey Rubin, M.D.</v-card-title>\n            <br />\n            <p>(Medical College of Virginia)</p>\n            <p>51 E. 90th St., New York, NY 10128.

I have acted as producer, director, and writer of corporate films, videotapes and interactive videodiscs for clients such as IBM, AT&T, Sony, U.S. Department of Education, SmithKline, and Miles Pharmaceuticals.</p>\n                <p>I was introduced to the writings of Karen Horney by Dr. Milton Berger. In the course of my dramatic writing projects I found that her profound insights into character helped in the creation and polishing of scripts. Reading Dr. Bernard Paris's work has also been helpful.</p>\n                <p>As a student of dramatic theory, it has been clear to me that 'drama is conflict.' The dramatic effect, often culminating in what Aristotle called catharsis, is based upon an audience member identifying with a protagonist and vicariously traveling with him on a quest to find his 'real self' in the face of obstacles. Well-crafted drama is a 'gymnasium for the emotions' of the audience, giving them a chance to exercise their tears, laughter, fright, and flight.</p>\n                <p>I am particularly interested in how emotional effects are achieved in the audience. I have a lifelong interest in magic, and have worked on the question of why people will always need a 'magic' to believe in, and what is entertaining about it. The late Slydini, considered one of the patriarchs of modern close-up conjuring, was one of my teachers.</p>\n                <p>Psychoanalysis has clearly had a strong influence on 20th century drama. Jung is useful for grasping drama's mythic nature, and drama has often been fraught with Freudian conflicts and symbolism. I have found that Horney's work offers the clearest and most practical way to look at dramatic characters.</p>\n                <p>I should like to hear from anyone involved in the Horneyan analysis of drama. I am particularly interested in analyses of popular motion pictures. Stage drama is of interest as well, as is any theoretical work on audience psychology.</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Jane Simon, M.D.</v-card-title>\n                <br />\n                <p>(Temple University)</p>\n                <p>145 Central Park West, Suite 1A, New York, NY 10023.

We study literary characters who have become alienated from their real selves and are committed to trying to actualize a false, glorified self. We discuss the kinds of defensive strategies these characters employ while they are subject to the 'tyranny of the should.' An example of a character who primarily 'moves away' from other people is Dolly Urquhart in D. H. Lawrence's 'The Princess.' [See \"Lawrence's 'The Princess' and Horney's 'Idealized Self'\" in Third Force Psychology and the Study of Literature, ed. B. J. Paris.] We also analyze characters who move toward and/or against others. Horney's concepts are invaluable for providing new insights into works of literature.\"</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Jeanne Smith, M.D.</v-card-title>\n                <br />\n                <p>(N.Y.

I had initially felt enthusiastic, but a feeling of emptiness began to erode my satisfaction in the work of psychotherapy. I did not feel at home with other theorists, and I felt even less comfortable with the evolving jargon of psychoanalysis. This was a serious crisis for me, since I had chosen psychoanalytical understanding as my life's work.</p>\n                <p>It was when I sought supervision in 1993 from Herbert M. Perr, M.D., a member of the IKHS, that he introduced me to the general principles of Horney, with particular emphasis on Neurosis and Human Growth. With Dr. Perr's guidance, Horney's ideas have given me a map of mental functioning which I find extremely useful for myself and my patients.</p>\n                <p>With Horney, I have experienced a deep sense of hope, a beacon in the darkness, a potential for a certain wholeness of understanding. She seemed to be in touch with her own inner reservoir of aliveness, an internal well of boundless energy that becomes available as the encumberments of the neurotic structure fall away. Her teachings have helped me to begin to break through the rigidity in my approach to myself and others, and have helped me to reach toward my own inner reservoir of genuine feelings.\"</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Stephanie Steinfeld, Ph.D.</v-card-title>\n                <br />\n                <p>[deceased]</p>\n                <p>400 East 58th St., New York, NY 10021.

Her perspective on the cultural sources of white middle class neurosis was particularly helpful for my own work on a similar theme amongst Chinese Americans. I am presently finishing a book-length manuscript on a Taoist approach to psychotherapy. Horney's notion of health as reflected in a flexible style of relating resonates to the Taoist idea of 'true identity' as 'no identity.'\"</p>\n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-layout row wrap>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n                <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Robert Tucker, Ph.D.</v-card-title>\n                <br />\n                <p>(Philosophy, Harvard)</p>\n                <p>44 Hartley Ave., Princeton, NJ 08540.

His original training was in philosophy. A student of Horney's thought since his student days at Harvard in the early 1940s, he subsequently drew on her theory of the neurotic personality in his work on a doctoral thesis in philosophy which was published in 1961 as Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx. In Russian studies his work as a biographer of Stalin and historian of the Stalin era has turned in a crucial way on a view of Stalin as a classic case of Horney's 'arrogant-vindictive' type. His Horneyan interpretation of Stalin has guided him in Stalin as Revolutionary, 1879-1929 and Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above, 1928-1941, and will figure in the projected third volume of the trilogy, Stalin, Russia, and the World: The War and Postwar Years, 1941-1953.\"</p>\n                <p>Professor Tucker's books on Stalin are published by W.
