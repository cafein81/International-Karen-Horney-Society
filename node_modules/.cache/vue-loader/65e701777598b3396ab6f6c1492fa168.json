Descriptions of the personality typologies in Neurosis and Human Growth were analyzed, revealing measurable constructs: attachment, emotional regulation, internal dialogue, sociotropy, autonomy, self-defeating behavior, and identity status. Each personality group was expected to display a distinct pattern for each construct, based on Horney's theory . . . .

This study compares Horney's observations of patients, particularly those having arrogant-vindictive character trends, with the known facts of Hitler's life. Finding a close match over the course of Hitler's life, the study argues that Hitler can be viewed as a \"destruction artist,\" with his failure to find success in the artistic realm as the source of his relentless enmity toward Jews and the reason he moved to the political arena, where his need to triumph over other mercilessly was a pathological manifestation of his search for glory.</p>\n                    <p>Dr. Wiesner is a psychologist who has been trained in psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

Phil - I am Lecturer in Continuing Education at the University of Sussex, where I teach theory and practice of creative writing. My primary research interests are in the use of autobiographical creative writing as a developmental or therapeutic tool in higher education. My D.Phil. (completed 1999) explored the experience of students taking my creative writing course 'Autobiography and the Imagination', some of whom derived therapeutic benefit from fictionalising themselves, their experience and significant people in their lives. I made extensive use of the theories of Karen Horney in analysing the material that arose out of this research and found these theories particularly helpful in understanding the difficulties that some of these students experienced in creating fictional characters based on themselves. These difficulties I interpreted as arising out of inner conflicts between different 'life solutions', in the Horneyan sense. I saw the writing of fictional autobiography as a means of provoking a 'metaphorical confrontation' with these conflicts that facilitated a deeper emotional understanding of them and hence therapeutic benefit. Against this background, I then explored, using Horney's theories and the literary critical work of Bernard Paris that draws on them, the possibility that fictional autobiography might be used as a means of self-therapy. The research was published in my book Therapeutic Dimensions of Autobiography in Creative Writing (Jessica Kingsley, London, 2000; ISBN 1853027472)</p>\n                    <p>Contact details:</p>\n                    <p>Dr. Celia Hunt, Centre for Continuing Education, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RG, England, UK.</p>\n                    <p>Phone: (01273) 678040</p>\n                    <p>Fax: (01273) 678848</p>\n                    <p>Email: c.m.hunt@sussex.ac.uk</p>\n                    <P>I'd like to add to what Dr. Hunt has said that in 1993 she wrote a Master's dissertation at the University of Sussex on \"The Inner Conflicts of Franz Kafka: A Horneyan Approach to the Man and His Writings.\" BJP</P>\n                  </v-card>\n                </v-flex>\n              </v-layout>\n            </v-flex>\n            <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n              <v-layout row wrap>\n                <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n                  <v-card class=\"longcard\">\n                    <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Benjamin Tong</v-card-title>\n                    <br />\n                    <p>From Benjamin Tong, Ph.D. drbt@hotmail.com I continue to make full use of Horney's work in my teaching and supervision of clinical psychology students at the California Institute of Integral Studies (San Francisco).

There were many reasons for this, including the bond between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian cultures at the beginning of the last century, Freud's love of Italy and his contact with the first Italian psychoanalyst (Weiss), and the opposition of the Fascist regime. However, in 1989 legal recognition was given to the practice of psychotherapy by physicians and psychologists trained not only in public universities but also in private Schools of Specialization in Psychotherapy. Since then, numerous other psychoanalytic approaches have flourished, including those of such \"Neofreudians\" as Karen Horney, which before had been cultivated only by a few.</p>\n                    <p>Clinical practice inspired by Horney's theory, especially as applied to groups, was introduced in Italy by Vincent A. Morrone, M.D., who was born in New York, educated in Italy, and trained at the American Institute for Psychoanalysis, where he studied with people who had been members of Horney's inner circle, including Harold Kelman, Norman Kelman, Isidore Portnoy, and Louis De Rosis. He also studied with such pioneers of group analysis as Alexander Wolf, H. Durkin, H. Kadis, and H. Glazer. Returning to Italy, Dr. Morrone spread the Horneyan approach through his training of psychiatrists at the University of Rome and his supervision of medical and psychological professionals practicing in some public Mental Health Centers in Rome. In 1989, he founded the Società di Psicoanalisi Interpersonale e Gruppo-Analisi (SPIGA), which annexed the School of Specialization in Psychotherapy and which was legally recognized in January of 2001. Dr. Morrone serves as Director, Teacher-Trainer, and Supervisor at SPIGA. The SPIGA website is at www.spigahorney.it . Horney theory is also taught at Ergon -- istituto di psicoanalisi e di psicotherapia interpersonale, which is located in Bari and directed by Giuseppe Miccolis.</p>\n                    <p>The academic diffusion of Horney's theory in Italy has been the work of Diego Garofalo diegogarofalo@tiscalinet.it , who studied Philosophy at the University of Rome and Psychology at the University of Padua before receiving his Ph.D. at the Salesian University of Rome. He has been trained in psychoanalysis first by Claudio Modigliani (formerly secretary of the Società Psiocoanalitica Italiana) and then by Vincent Morrone. While at Padua in 1979, he published the first and only Italian textbook on Horney's thought: La psicoanalisi interpersonale. Introduzione all'opera di Karen Horney (CLEUP, Padova, preface by Allesandro Salvini). In 1995, he placed Horney's theory in the wider context of Neofreudian thought in Una psicoanalisi a misura d'uomo. Le nuove vie dei neofrueudiani (EDUP, Roma, preface by Luigi Cancrini). Finally, as a result of his participation as teacher-trainer in the SPIGA School of Specialization, he has written about Horneyan theory in relation to group analysis in Analisi di gruppo. La prospettiva inerpersonale di Karen Horney (EDUP, Roma, 2001), peface by Antonello Correale). In this volume, he interlaces Horney's insights with those of many other more \"orthodox\" analysts, such as Winnicott, Bion, and object relations theorists. He argues that Horney's interpersonal perspective anticipated the modern orientation of psychotherapy toward the so-called auto-eco-systemic paradigm. This paradigm is based on the auto-organization of organisms (from Goldstein to Maturana and Varela and recent developmental system theory); on the ecological conception of mind (from Smut's holism to Bateson's interdisciplinary approach); and on the cybernetic consideration of every development (from the first relational-systemic theory to those of second order cybernetics -- e.g., Keeney, von Forester).</p>\n                    <p>At this point, a closer collaboration of Horney's school with complementary ones currently existing in Italy would be desirable. These include the Istituto Erich Fromm di Psicoanalisi Neofreudiania in Bologna romano@vegatel.it , the Istituto di Psicoterapia Analitica H. S. Sullivan in Florence ipa.sullivan@tin.it , and the Istituto Neofreudiana di Psiconanalisi in Milan (Via Malzi d'Eril, 32 -- 20154 Milano).</p>\n                    <p>Submitted by Diego Garofalo; edited by BJP</p>\n                  </v-card>\n                </v-flex>\n                <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n                  <v-card class=\"longcard\" height=\"1130px\">\n                    <v-card-title class=\"cent\">East-European Institute of Psychoanalysis (EEIP)</v-card-title>\n                    <br />\n                    <p>From Russia.
