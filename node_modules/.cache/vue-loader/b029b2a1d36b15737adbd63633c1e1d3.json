J. Paris. At a time when I was reading the novels of Anita Desai (an Indo-English novelist) and was trying to find a suitable approach, Horney\\'s theory attracted me immediately. Using Horney, I wrote a dissertation on Anita Desai that was subsequently published in India as a book; and I then spent two terms at the University of Florida doing post-doctoral work with Dr. Paris. I am proud to say that I am the first person to take up the Horneyan approach in India, and I wish to continue my efforts to introduce Horney to Indian scholars. I am currently working on a book to be entitled The Psychological Novels of William Golding, and I hope in future to work on Indo-English Literature and Horney.
