She believes that misogyny is what fuels patriarchy and advocates that women live their lives on the boundaries of patriarchal society, expending their energies 'Outercoursing' to the 'Background' biophilic, gynocentric world. To evaluate Daly's pathological diagnosis and resolution to it, I turn to Karen Horney. There is much in Horney that affirms Daly's description: the patriarchal male as aggressive-vindictive; the patriarchal female as compliant and morbidly dependent. Interestingly enough, Daly's liberated woman resembles Horney's detached-resigned neurotic type, suggesting more pathology where liberation is thought to lie. The resolution might be found in Horney's belief that self-hate--a refusal to be who one actually is--is at the root of pathology, patriarchal or otherwise. This insight would have implications for Daly's psychological assessment of patriarchy and her resolution to it.\\\"\"\n                        )\n                      ])\n                    ],\n                    1\n                  )\n                ],\n                1\n              ),\n              _c(\n                \"v-flex\",\n                { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                [\n                  _c(\n                    \"v-card\",\n                    { staticClass: \"long-card\" },\n                    [\n                      _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                        _vm._v(\"Marco Ermacora\")\n                      ]),\n                      _c(\"br\"),\n                      _c(\"p\", [\n                        _vm._v(\n                          \"2427 Lockhart, Montreal, Quebec H3P 1X6.
