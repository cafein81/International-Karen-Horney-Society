Dissertation topic: Patriarchy and Self-Hate: Mary Daly Assessed and Evaluated in the Context of Karen Horney's Psychoanalytic Theory. [2001 - dissertation completed; now a Ph.D.]</p>\n            <p>\"Mary Daly has written extensively on the pathology of patriarchy found in religion and permeating society. She believes that misogyny is what fuels patriarchy and advocates that women live their lives on the boundaries of patriarchal society, expending their energies 'Outercoursing' to the 'Background' biophilic, gynocentric world. To evaluate Daly's pathological diagnosis and resolution to it, I turn to Karen Horney. There is much in Horney that affirms Daly's description: the patriarchal male as aggressive-vindictive; the patriarchal female as compliant and morbidly dependent. Interestingly enough, Daly's liberated woman resembles Horney's detached-resigned neurotic type, suggesting more pathology where liberation is thought to lie. The resolution might be found in Horney's belief that self-hate--a refusal to be who one actually is--is at the root of pathology, patriarchal or otherwise. This insight would have implications for Daly's psychological assessment of patriarchy and her resolution to it.\"</p>\n          </v-card>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n            <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Marco Ermacora</v-card-title>\n            <br />\n            <p>2427 Lockhart, Montreal, Quebec H3P 1X6.

What is a non-neurotic way to go about doing politics? And what are the different dynamics of the neurotic styles of doing politics?\"</p>\n          </v-card>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-card class=\"long-card\" height=\"320px\">\n            <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Phyllis Grosskurth, Ph.D</v-card-title>\n            <br />\n            <p>(English, University of London).</p>\n            <p>147 Spruce St., Toronto M5A 2J6.
