The need to improve my education led me to the reading of psychoanalytic literature. The ideas of Karen Horney can be applied in different countries, and her introduction of self-analysis as a supporting method would significantly facilitate the training of psychoanalysts from the former East European countries. Reading her essays strongly influenced my wish to specialize in psychiatry in the U.S. I came to this country recently and am now in the process of preparing for the exams necessary for getting into a residency. I shall be glad to contact analysts whose work is based on Horney's ideas. At present I live in Boston and would like to meet analysts working in this region. I am also available for international communication. I speak French, English, some German, and, as a Bulgarian, I am fluent in Russian. In East European countries there is still a considerable deficit regarding psychoanalytic literature. I would be glad to help with the translation and publishing of Horney's works abroad.\\\"\"\n                        )\n                      ])\n                    ],\n                    1\n                  )\n                ],\n                1\n              ),\n              _c(\n                \"v-flex\",\n                { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                [\n                  _c(\n                    \"v-layout\",\n                    { attrs: { row: \"\", wrap: \"\" } },\n                    [\n                      _c(\n                        \"v-flex\",\n                        { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                        [\n                          _c(\n                            \"v-card\",\n                            { staticClass: \"long-card\" },\n                            [\n                              _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                                _vm._v(\"Eric W.

Her account of the masochist's seemingly excessive suffering as an attempt to dissolve the boundaries of the self is helpful in explaining the controversial ending of Bellow's novel. I am working on a Ph.D. in English at the University of Florida and I also plan on training as an analyst. I would be interested in learning about psychoanalytic institutes around the world that are open to the training of lay analysts and use the ideas of Horney and Erich Fromm as guiding theories.\\\"\"\n                                )\n                              ])\n                            ],\n                            1\n                          )\n                        ],\n                        1\n                      )\n                    ],\n                    1\n                  )\n                ],\n                1\n              ),\n              _c(\n                \"v-flex\",\n                { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                [\n                  _c(\n                    \"v-layout\",\n                    { attrs: { row: \"\", wrap: \"\" } },\n                    [\n                      _c(\n                        \"v-flex\",\n                        { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                        [\n                          _c(\n                            \"v-card\",\n                            { staticClass: \"long-card\" },\n                            [\n                              _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                                _vm._v(\"Arnaldo Apolito, M.D.\")\n                              ]),\n                              _c(\"br\"),\n                              _c(\"p\", [_vm._v(\"(U. of Naples)\")]),\n                              _c(\"p\", [\n                                _vm._v(\n                                  \"80 Undercliff Road, Montclair, NJ 07042.

I have a private practice in psychiatry and psychoanalysis and teach part-time in a psychiatric residency. Along with a small group of colleagues, I am working to establish an interdisciplinary training program in psychoanalytic psychotherapy in our area (the Southwest Center for Psychoanalytic Studies).\"'\n                                )\n                              ])\n                            ],\n                            1\n                          )\n                        ],\n                        1\n                      )\n                    ],\n                    1\n                  )\n                ],\n                1\n              ),\n              _c(\n                \"v-flex\",\n                { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                [\n                  _c(\n                    \"v-layout\",\n                    { attrs: { row: \"\", wrap: \"\" } },\n                    [\n                      _c(\n                        \"v-flex\",\n                        { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                        [\n                          _c(\n                            \"v-card\",\n                            { staticClass: \"long-card\" },\n                            [\n                              _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                                _vm._v(\"Bernard G.

A person who know how to read and write has been given a technique for self-improvement that has been in the forefront of advancing civilization and has begun a journey that lasts his whole life. So it can be with psychoanalytic literacy. Just as language literacy required a long period of development to arrive at the role it now plays in civilization, so it is probable that the same is the destiny of psychoanalysis. Today barely a century old, it is an idea before its time. We can only conjecture as to how long it will take to fulfill its destiny.

A more complete understanding of Horney's concept of the Real Self and how it relates to the structures and processes described in the Self Theories in Humanistic psychology. 3. A general exploration of the common ground between Horney and the work of George Kelly in his Psychology of Personal Constructs--specifically the contributions they both made in helping us to understand what it means to have a profound interest in the nature of an adult unconscious which cannot be reduced to a set of infantile concerns.\\\"\"\n                        )\n                      ])\n                    ],\n                    1\n                  )\n                ],\n                1\n              ),\n              _c(\n                \"v-flex\",\n                { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                [\n                  _c(\n                    \"v-layout\",\n                    { attrs: { row: \"\", wrap: \"\" } },\n                    [\n                      _c(\n                        \"v-flex\",\n                        { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                        [\n                          _c(\n                            \"v-card\",\n                            { staticClass: \"long-card\" },\n                            [\n                              _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                                _vm._v(\"James Fadiman, Ph.D.\")\n                              ]),\n                              _c(\"br\"),\n                              _c(\"p\", [_vm._v(\"(Stanford)\")]),\n                              _c(\"p\", [\n                                _vm._v(\n                                  \"1070 Colby Ave., Menlo Park, CA 94025.

I went to medical school after having worked as a sculptor and a graphic artist for about fifteen years. I went to medical school in Mexico and came to love that country. I like things that help me see things clearly (from an intellectual as well as from a visual point of view). I like medicine, biology, the visual arts, and poetry. I also like things that help me to bear the joys of life as well as enjoy its suffering. I like friendship, psychoanalysis, dance.

I am interested in the meaning of this concept from various perspectives--such as the personal meanings it held for Horney herself, the development of its meanings and theoretical role in her theories, its uses in her therapeutic approach. I explore also Horney's development of the meanings of the experienced real self or of being oneself--for instance, of wholeheartedness, of being in the present moment--and the relation of this development to her interest in Zen. My work examines connections between the evolutionary process of the idea of the real self and Karen Horney's creative process in working out her philosophy, theories, concepts, and therapeutic approach. Another focus of my interest is how the development and underpinnings of Horney's later work are related to her early work in feminine psychology.\\\"\"\n                                )\n                              ]),\n                              _c(\"P\", [\n                                _vm._v(\n                                  \"Work address: Women's Psychotherapy Centre of Wisconsin, 16 N.

But because the analysis often strikes so close to home for many of us, it is sometimes blatantly misinterpreted and dismissed as 'psycho-baloney.'\\\"\"\n                                )\n                              ])\n                            ],\n                            1\n                          )\n                        ],\n                        1\n                      )\n                    ],\n                    1\n                  )\n                ],\n                1\n              ),\n              _c(\n                \"v-flex\",\n                { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                [\n                  _c(\n                    \"v-layout\",\n                    { attrs: { row: \"\", wrap: \"\" } },\n                    [\n                      _c(\n                        \"v-flex\",\n                        { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                        [\n                          _c(\n                            \"v-card\",\n                            { staticClass: \"long-card\" },\n                            [\n                              _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                                _vm._v(\"Robin Steier Goldberg, Ph.D.\")\n                              ]),\n                              _c(\"br\"),\n                              _c(\"p\", [\n                                _vm._v(\"(Clinical Psychology, Fordham U)\")\n                              ]),\n                              _c(\"p\", [\n                                _vm._v(\n                                  \"1349 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10128.

I've published eleven books of literary criticism of which The Dynamics of Literary Response (1968, 1979, 1989) and Poems in Persons (1973, 1975. 1989) are the best known and deal with people's responses to literature. The I (1985) is a purely psychological synthesis of ideas about human personality and development. In recent years, I've become interested in new ways people can express in more appealing forms the abstract ideas about, for example, literary criticism, forms such as personal essays, fiction, the Internet, hypermedia.\\\" Professor Holland's most recent publication is Death in a Delphi Seminar (a novel), SUNY Press, 1995.\"\n                                )\n                              ])\n                            ],\n                            1\n                          )\n                        ],\n                        1\n                      )\n                    ],\n                    1\n                  )\n                ],\n                1\n              ),\n              _c(\n                \"v-flex\",\n                { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                [\n                  _c(\n                    \"v-layout\",\n                    { attrs: { row: \"\", wrap: \"\" } },\n                    [\n                      _c(\n                        \"v-flex\",\n                        { attrs: { \"d-flex\": \"\", xs12: \"\" } },\n                        [\n                          _c(\n                            \"v-card\",\n                            { staticClass: \"long-card\" },\n                            [\n                              _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                                _vm._v(\"Roberta C.

Americans for the most part have lived in a threatening environment and have responded both individually and collectively with a clear search for glory, formation of idealized selves, and most often an expansive strategy for coping with life. The book traces this pattern in popular culture from movies to comic strips, in politics from Presidents to popular votes, in cultural institutions such as religion and business, and in history from the revolution to the present. Examples of individuals (such as Kennedy and Johnson in politics, Kirk Douglas and Marilyn Monroe in film) and of groups (such as the Mormons and political and economic bureaucracies), as well as historical and cultural trends, are used to support the basic argument.\"'\n                                )\n                              ]),\n                              _c(\"p\", [\n                                _vm._v(\n                                  'Recent essay: \"A Horneyan Approach to American Literature,\" in Dionysus in Literature: Essays on Literary Madness, ed.

I have published several papers using Horney to interpret conflicts in characters (The Journal of Evolutionary Psychology), and I have introduced Horney to the audience at several conferences. My particular interest--and I would be very happy to hear from anyone working in this area--is to study the application of non-Freudian psychoanalytic theory to female writers. I have found in my extensive work on Edith Wharton that many feminists deplore Freud but see no practical alternatives for psychological criticism.

Some of the strategies she has described can be seen as pseudo adaptations to the power struggles and control battles that go on within the family. Since competition is in the air we breathe but conflicts with the value we place on highly affiliative relationships, the struggle to evolve a system to deconstruct unhealthy competitive mindsets is an important one. Moving away from highly competitive positions has the reward of richer and closer connections both within ourselves and between ourselves and others.

We study literary characters who have become alienated from their real selves and are committed to trying to actualize a false, glorified self. We discuss the kinds of defensive strategies these characters employ while they are subject to the 'tyranny of the should.' An example of a character who primarily 'moves away' from other people is Dolly Urquhart in D. H. Lawrence's 'The Princess.' [See \\\"Lawrence's 'The Princess' and Horney's 'Idealized Self'\\\" in Third Force Psychology and the Study of Literature, ed. B. J.

His original training was in philosophy. A student of Horney's thought since his student days at Harvard in the early 1940s, he subsequently drew on her theory of the neurotic personality in his work on a doctoral thesis in philosophy which was published in 1961 as Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx. In Russian studies his work as a biographer of Stalin and historian of the Stalin era has turned in a crucial way on a view of Stalin as a classic case of Horney's 'arrogant-vindictive' type.
