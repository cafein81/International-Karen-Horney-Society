While not saying that the whole population is neurotically aggressive, Wachtel feels that Horney\\'s \"concept of the moving-against . . . trend captures something important about the manifest patterns of behavior that most characterize our public life and the workings of our economic system\" (78). We promote competition rather than mutual support, and in our relation to nature and the environment, \"we strive for conquest and domination.\" We are afraid of being perceived as \"a \\'pitiful helpless giant\\' and will commit unreasonable acts of aggression to ward off that feared image\" (75). Caught in a vicious circle, we anxiously rely \"on the production and accumulation of goods\" for our sense of security (79) and continue to do this despite the fact that it makes us more insecure. Wachtel develops these ideas further in \"The Preoccupation with Economic Growth: An Analysis Informed by Horneyan Theory\" (1991).'\n                    )\n                  ]),\n                  _c(\"p\", [\n                    _vm._v(\n                      \"(commentary provided by Bernard J.
