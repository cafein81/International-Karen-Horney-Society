Horney's theory presaged other more general currents in psychological thought that have become popular today. One has been the increasing emphasis on socio-cultural factors as the causes of emotional illness. She would have found this overall trend congenial. But not completely! She would have disagreed with the degree to which society is blamed for neurosis and the resulting attempts to treat neurosis by simply changing social conditions. In point of fact, even though she continues to be considered a 'Neo-Freudian culturalist' psychoanalyst, this classification is misleading. It was based on her earlier work; she remained individual-oriented and in her later work focused almost exclusively on the inner structure of the psyche.\\\"\"\n                  )\n                ]),\n                _c(\"p\", [_vm._v(\"(op. cit., p. 317)\")])\n              ])\n            ],\n            1\n          )\n        ],\n        1\n      ),\n      _c(\"Footer\")\n    ],\n    1\n  )\n}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\nrender._withStripped = true\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }"]}
