On such themes as love, death, and the imagination, there is an intricate relationship between the psychoanalytic figure of the instinct--'the drive'--and the literary figure of the character--the 'driven.' Accepting Shoshana Felman's helpful warning against literature's subsidiary position in a slave-master relationship with psychoanalysis, my book traces some dramatic reflections between psychoanalysis (in, above all, Beyond the Pleasure Principle) and fiction (Frankenstein, Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, Lord Jim, and Sons and Lovers).\"</p>\n        </v-card>\n      </v-flex>\n    </v-layout>\n  </v-container>\n  <Footer />\n</div>\n",null]}
