International conferences\\n                were held in New York in 1993 and Rome in 1994, and there were other meetings of a more local nature. In 1995, the\\n                IKHS conducted a four day seminar on \\\"Karen Horney's Theory and Its Applications in Science and Clinical Practice\\\" at\\n                the East European Institute of Psychoanalysis in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Society has sponsored translations of\\n                Horney's works into Russian and Chinese and has assisted those working with Horney in various parts of the world,\\n                including South Korea.\\n              \"\n                    )\n                  ]),\n                  _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                    _vm._v(\"Current Activities\")\n                  ]),\n                  _c(\"v-card-text\", { staticClass: \"cont\" }, [\n                    _vm._v(\n                      \"\\n          2016 marks the 25th anniversary since the founding of the International Karen Horney Society in 1991 by\\n          Prof. Bernard J.

One of the goals of the IKHS this year is to take stock of\\n          recent and ongoing developments related to Horney’s theory and works. Another is to show connections between\\n          her psychodynamic theory with computer science and the model of the mind that have been brought to light by Dr.\\n          Andrew N. Tershakovec (1921–2007). A third goal is to identify how Horneyan theory can be placed in systematic\\n          relation to the theory of dreaming consciousness of Dr. J. Allan Hobson.\\n        \"\n                    )\n                  ]),\n                  _c(\"v-card-text\", { staticClass: \"cont\" }, [\n                    _vm._v(\n                      \"\\n          Since 1997, the Society has continued to sponsor translations and to facilitate the study of Horney in countries\\n          where materials have been hard to obtain, but it has stopped holding conferences, adding new members, collecting\\n          dues, and issuing reports, bulletins, and membership directories. In 2001, the IKHS entered a new phase of activity\\n          with the establishment of this website. The objectives of the website are those the Society was originally formed\\n          to implement: to help those interested in Horney to become aware of each other, to inform people of developments\\n          in Horney studies, and to help people learn about Horney's ideas.\\n        \"\n                    )\n                  ]),\n                  _c(\"v-card-title\", { staticClass: \"h4\" }, [\n                    _vm._v(\"Membership\")\n                  ]),\n                  _c(\"v-card-text\", { staticClass: \"cont\" }, [\n                    _vm._v(\n                      \"\\n          The IKHS no longer formally enrolls members or collects dues, but anyone wishing to be added to the membership\\n          directory should send an e-mail to bjparis@ufl.edu with pertinent information, and his or her entry will be added\\n          when this website is next updated.
