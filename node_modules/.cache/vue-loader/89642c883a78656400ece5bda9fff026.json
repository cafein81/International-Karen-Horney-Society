I have participated in seminars, symposia, and round tables in which I have tried to make Greek psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers aware of different aspects of Horney theory. I am interested in politics, social psychology, ecology, etc. I am an active member of the \"Movement of Self-Consciousness and Self-Protection,\" located here in Patras, which has as its goal the application of self-development techniques in order to prevent cruelty, aggression, destructiveness, and war. I wrote a book in Greek analyzing war and destructiveness from the perspective of social psychology in 1989.
