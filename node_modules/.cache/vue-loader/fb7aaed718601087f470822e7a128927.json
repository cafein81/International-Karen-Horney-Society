These essays were too far ahead of their time to receive the attention they deserved, but they have been widely read since their republication in Feminine Psychology in 1967, and there is a growing consensus that Karen Horney was the first great psychoanalytic feminist.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Those who are attracted to the second stage of Horney’s thought identify her primarily as a neo-Freudian member of “the cultural school,” which also included Erich Fromm, Harry Stack Sullivan, Clara Thompson, and Abraham Kardiner. In The Neurotic Personality of Our Time (1937) and New Ways in Psychoanalysis (1939), Horney broke with Freud and developed a psychoanalytic paradigm in which culture and disturbed human relationships replaced biology as the most important causes of neurotic development. The Neurotic Personality of Our Time made Horney famous in intellectual circles. It created a heightened awareness of cultural factors in mental disturbance and inspired studies of culture from a psychoanalytic perspective. Because of its criticism of Freud, New Ways in Psychoanalysis made Horney infamous amongst orthodox analysts and led to her ostracism from the psychoanalytic establishment. Although it paid tribute to Freud’s genius and the importance of his contribution, it rejected many of his premises and tried to shift the focus of psychoanalysis from infantile origins to the current structure of the personality. It laid the foundations for the development of present-oriented therapies, which have become increasingly important in recent years (Wachtel 1977).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In the 1940s Horney developed her mature theory, which many feel to be her most distinctive contribution. In Our Inner Conflicts (1945) and Neurosis and Human Growth (1950), she argued that individuals cope with the anxiety produced by feeling unsafe, unloved, and unvalued by disowning their real feelings and developing elaborate strategies of defense. In Our Inner Conflicts, she concentrated on the interpersonal defenses of moving toward, against, and away from other people and the neurotic solutions of compliance, aggression, and detachment to which they give rise. In Neurosis and Human Growth, she emphasized intrapsychic defenses, showing how self-idealization generates a search for glory and what she called “the pride system,” which consists of neurotic pride, neurotic claims, tyrannical shoulds, and self-hate. The range and power of Horney’s mature theory has been shown not only by its clinical applications, but also by its use in such fields as literary criticism, biography, and the study of culture and gender.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The object of therapy for Horney is to help people relinquish their defenses -- which alienate them from their true likes and dislikes, hopes, fears, and desires -- so that they can get in touch with what she called the “real self.” Because of her emphasis on self-realization as the source of healthy values and the goal of life, Horney is one of the founders of humanistic psychology.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Personal History\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Karen Horney was born Karen Danielsen in a suburb of Hamburg on September 15, 1885.

She received her medical education at the universities of Freiburg, Göttingen, and Berlin.

In 1910, she entered analysis with Karl Abraham, a member of Freud’s inner circle and the first psychoanalyst to practice in Germany. She decided to become an analyst herself and in 1920 was one of the six founding members of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. She taught there until 1932, when Franz Alexander invited her to become Associate Director of the newly formed Chicago Psychoanalytic Institute. She joined the faculty of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in 1934 but was driven out in 1941 as a result of the publication of New Ways in Psychoanalysis. She founded the American Institute for Psychoanalysis the same year and was dean until her death in 1952.

She felt that she had been unwanted and that her brother was much more highly valued than she, principally because he was a male. Since she disliked her father, whom she regarded as religious hypocrite, and her mother confided in her brother, she felt alone and unsupported in the family. To compensate for this, she tried to attach herself to her brother, with whom she seems to have engaged in some kind of sex play between the ages of 5 and 9. When her brother distanced himself from her on reaching puberty, Karen felt rejected and tried to gain a sense of worth by becoming fiercely competitive in school.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"As a child, Karen was bitter, angry, and rebellious, but when she reached puberty, she could no longer tolerate her isolation and won a position in the family by joining the circle of her mother’s admirers. At the age of thirteen, she began keeping a diary (Horney 1980) in which she expressed adoration of her mother and brother. Her buried hostility toward them erupted when she was twenty-one, however, and her relations with them were strained thereafter. The diaries that were written while Karen was repressing her anger give a misleading picture of her relations with her family and must be read in light of the Clare case in Self-Analysis (1942), which is highly autobiographical. This case, which appears in three other places as well, provides information about Karen’s earlier history and explains her behavior during adolescence. Although Karen’s diaries are misleading about her relations with her family, they reveal her emotional problems quite clearly. She suffered from depression, timidity, and paralyzing fatigue, could not bear being without a boyfriend, was insecure about her mental abilities, and felt like an ugly duckling who could not compete with her beautiful mother. She had great difficulty focusing on her work and was able to succeed academically only because of her exceptional intelligence.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Karen’s diaries were mostly devoted to her relationships with males, from whom she desperately needed attention. The typical pattern of her relationships was first idealization of the male, followed by disappointment, depression, and efforts to comprehend why the relationship failed. Because of her disappointments, she moved from man to man, often trying to hold onto several at once because each satisfied different demands. She hoped to find a great man who could fulfill her conflicting needs for dominance and submission, crude force and refined sensibility, but she was perpetually disappointed. Deeply unhappy, she tried to understand the sources of her misery, first in her diaries and then in her psychoanalytic writings, many of which are covert autobiography.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"At first Karen thought that Oskar Horney was the great man for whom she had been looking, but he was not forceful enough, and the marriage was soon in trouble.

The failure of her analysis is one reason why she began to question orthodox theory, especially with respect to the psychology of women.

First in Chicago and then in New York, she found patients with very different kinds of problems than those she had encountered in Germany. This experience, combined with her reading in the burgeoning sciences of sociology and anthropology, made her doubt the universality of the Oedipus complex and led her to explore the impact of culture on individual psychology. In 1935, she lectured on this topic at the New School for Social Research and was invited by W. W. Norton to write the book that became The Neurotic Personality of Our Time.

She had known Fromm when he was a student at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute (he was fifteen years younger than she), and she met him again when he lectured at the University of Chicago in 1933. They became lovers when both moved to New York in 1934. Their relationship was intellectual as well as emotional, with Fromm teaching Horney sociology and Horney teaching Fromm psychoanalysis. The relationship deteriorated in the late 1930s, after Horney sent her daughter Marianne, who was specializing in psychiatry, to Fromm for a training analysis. When Marianne’s hostilities toward her mother emerged in the course of analysis, as was to be expected, Horney blamed Fromm. The breakdown of the relationship was extremely painful to Horney and led to a period of intense self-analysis. This issued in the writing of Self-Analysis, in which the story of Clare and Peter is a fictionalized account of what happened between Horney and Fromm. Despite their estrangement, Fromm became a member of the American Institute for Psychoanalysis when it was founded in 1941, but Horney drove him out in 1942, using his status as a lay analyst (he had a Ph.D. rather than an M.D.) as a pretext.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The 1930s were a turbulent period for Horney, culminating with the hostile reaction of her colleagues at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute to her criticisms of Freud and her split with Erich Fromm. The 1940s were equally turbulent, since many of Horney’s most distinguished colleagues left the American Institute, one group (including Fromm, Harry Stack Sullivan, and Clara Thompson) to form the William Alanson White Institute and another to join the New York Medical College. These splits were partly the result of Horney’s need for dominance and her inability to grant others the kind of academic freedom she had demanded for herself at the New York Psychoanalytic. Horney continued to have difficulties in her love life, and these often contributed to dissension at her institute, since she tended to place men with whom she was having relationships in positions of power. Despite the political turmoil it involved, heading her own institute enabled Horney to flourish. It gave her the intellectual freedom she had always sought and facilitated the development of her mature theory.

Combined with her clinical experience, her self-analysis generated many of her psychoanalytic ideas. Her constant struggle to obtain relief from her problems was largely responsible for the continual evolution of her theory and the deepening of her insights.

The last fifteen years of her life are remarkable: she published five ground-breaking books; she was in great demand as an analyst, supervisor, and speaker; she founded and directed the American Institute for Psychoanalysis; she founded and edited The American Journal of Psychoanalysis; she taught at the New School on a regular basis; she read widely; she learned how to paint; she had many eminent friends and a busy social life; she spent much time in the summers with her daughters; and she traveled a great deal.

It is not difficult to see why the young Karen Horney was attracted to psychoanalysis. She suffered from many mysterious complaints and her ability to function was impaired. Of an introspective temperament, she had been in the habit of seeking relief by scrutinizing her feelings and motivations. Psychoanalysis offered the most powerful tools available for such an enterprise. She frequently recognized herself, moreover, in Freud’s description of women’s problems.

By the early 1920s she began to propose modifications in the light of her observations of her female patients and her own experiences as a woman. Perhaps the most important factor in Horney’s initial dissent was that she came to see psychoanalytic theory as reproducing and reinforcing the devaluation of the feminine from which she had suffered in childhood. Disturbed by the male bias of psychoanalysis, she dedicated herself to proposing a woman’s view of the differences between men and women and the disturbances in the relations between the sexes. This eventually led to the development of a psychoanalytic paradigm that was quite different from Freud’s, but Horney always paid tribute to what she regarded as Freud’s enduring contributions. These included the doctrines “that psychic processes are strictly determined, that actions and feelings may be determined by unconscious motivations, and that the motivations driving us are emotional forces” (Horney, 1939, p. 18). She valued Freud’s accounts of repression, reaction formation, projection, displacement, rationalization, and dreams; and she felt that Freud had provided indispensable tools for therapy in the concepts of transference, resistance, and free association (Horney, 1939, p. 117).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Alfred Adler\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Fritz Wittels (1939) argued that neo-Freudians like Horney were really closer to Adler than to Freud and should really be called neo-Adlerians.

In response to these influences, Horney argued not only that culture is more important than biology in the generation of neuroses, but also that pathogenic conflict between the individual and society is the product of a bad society rather than being inevitable as Freud had contended.

In her descriptions of the “real self,” she was inspired by James’s account of the “spiritual self” in Principles of Psychology (1890), and in her discussions of loss of self, she drew on Kierkegaard’s The Sickness Unto Death (1949).

The “womb-envy” of the male must be stronger than the so-called “penis-envy” of the female, since men need to depreciate women more than women need to depreciate men.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In later essays, Horney continued to analyze the male view of woman in order to expose its lack of scientific foundation. In “The Distrust between the Sexes” (1931), she argued that woman is seen as “a second-rate being” because “at any given time, the more powerful side will create an ideology suitable to help maintain its position. … In this ideology the differentness of the weaker one will be interpreted as inferiority, and it will be proven that these differences are unchangeable, basic, or God’s will” (Horney, 1967, p. 116). In “The Dread of Woman” (1932), Horney traced the male dread of woman to the boy’s fear that his genital is inadequate in relation to the mother. The threat of woman is not castration but humiliation; the threat is to his masculine self-regard. As he grows up, the male continues to have a deeply hidden anxiety about the size of his penis or his potency, an anxiety that has no counterpart for the female, who “performs her part by merely being” (Horney, 1967, p. 145) and is not obliged to go on proving her womanhood.

Although she initially argued that women are bound to have a masculinity complex because of their need to escape the guilt and anxiety that result from their oedipal situation, Horney soon came to feel that the masculinity complex is not inevitable but is the product of a male dominated culture and of particular kinds of family dynamics. The fact that “a girl is exposed from birth onward to the suggestion — inevitable, whether conveyed brutally or delicately — of her inferiority” is an experience “that constantly stimulates her masculinity complex” (Horney, 1967, p. 69).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In discussing family dynamics, Horney focused at first on the girl’s relationship with male members of the family, but later she derived the masculinity complex and all the phenomena traditionally associated with penis envy — such as feelings of inferiority, vindictiveness, and competitiveness toward men — from the girl’s relationship with females in the family, particularly the mother. In “Maternal Conflicts” (1933), she brought together the separate features of childhood to which she had attributed the masculinity complex in previous essays: “A girl may have reasons to acquire a dislike for her own female world very early, perhaps because her mother has intimidated her, or she has experienced a thoroughly disillusioning disappointment from the side of the father or brother; she may have had early sexual experiences that frightened her; or she may have found that her brother was greatly preferred to herself” (Horney, 1967, p. 179).

Most of the essay is devoted to trying to explain why these women have an obsessive need for a male but are unable to form satisfactory relationships. Their obsession is traced to a childhood situation in which each “had come off second best in the competition for a man” (Horney, 1967, p. 193).

The insecure girl develops an anxiety about being abnormal that often manifests itself as a fear that something is wrong with her genitals or that she is ugly and cannot possibly be attractive to men. As a defense, she may pay an inordinate amount of attention to her appearance or may wish to be a male. The most important defense is proving that, despite her disadvantages, she can attract a man.

Having been rejected by father or brother in childhood, they simultaneously need to prove their worth through erotic conquests and to make themselves invulnerable by avoiding deep emotional bonds.

In her lecture on “The Analyst’s Personal Equation,” she warned that “the fear that neurotic remnants may be exposed will make some analysts unduly cautious, thereby depriving the patient of the opportunity to experience his analyst as a human being with both shortcomings and assets” (1999, p. 193).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Horney frequently emphasized that analysis is a cooperative undertaking. Therapists can help their patients formulate and clarify the data, but the patients must supply it by revealing themselves. Perhaps the most important ways in which they can do this is through free association and the sharing of their dreams — things on which Horney placed more emphasis in her lectures than she did in her books. Self-revelation is difficult and must be facilitated by the therapist’s having a genuine respect for their patients, a sincere desire for their well-being, and a wholehearted interest in everything they think and feel. This will create a sense of trust that will make it easier for patients to tell everything that comes to them without selecting.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Horney rejected the then-prevailing authoritarian model of the therapist-patient relationship and proposed a democratic one instead. Therapists do not occupy a morally or psychologically superior position and should be humble about their ability to understand the patient. It will help them to attain a democratic spirit if they remember that, however experienced they are, they are “dealing with a particular patient and [their] knowledge of this patient is limited” (1999, p. 208). They should regard all interpretations as “more or less tentative” and should “be truthful about the degree of certainty” they feel (1999, p. 206). Their truthfulness has two advantages: their “groping will stimulate the patient to be active, to wonder, to search,” and it will have more meaning for the patient when they feel confident (1999, pp. 206–7).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"For Horney, the object of therapy is to help patients relinquish their defenses, accept themselves as they are, and replace their search for glory with a striving for self-realization. Insight is useful in leading patients to see that their defenses are self-defeating and cannot possibly work, but they must experience as well as understand the destructiveness of their solutions if they are to have a strong enough motivation to change.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"During the disillusioning phase of therapy, patients need support in dealing with discouragement, anxiety, and the realization of painful truths about themselves. The therapist assists them in overcoming fear or hopelessness, giving them a sense that their problems can be resolved. Patients will feel profoundly threatened when, “bereft of glory,” they realize they are “not as saintly, as loving, as powerful, as independent as [they] had believed” (Horney, 1942, p. 145). At this point, they need someone who does not lose faith in them, even though their own faith is gone. In the course of analysis, patients must confront not only their loss of glory but also their unsavory characteristics, which are the product of their neurosis. They tend to react with unconstructive self-hate, rather than with the self-acceptance that will enable them to grow. The analyst perceives that they are “striving and struggling human being[s]” and “still likes and respects” them as a result (1942, p. 145). This encouragement counteracts patients’ self-hate and helps them to like and respect themselves.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"As patients become less defensive in the course of therapy, their constructive forces grow stronger, and the central inner conflict emerges. The art of the therapist lies not only in helping patients to perceive, experience, and work through their neurotic solutions, but also in helping them to mobilize their constructive forces and supporting them in their struggle to find and actualize their real selves. Therapists must understand that there is a constant battle in patients between their desire to change and their fear of letting go of the strategies that have enabled them to survive in what they feel to be a dangerous, frustrating, unsympathetic world. They are motivated to change by both a desire to relieve their suffering and the constructive forces that are still alive within them, but they can relinquish their defenses only when they feel safe enough to do so. The therapist’s role is to assuage their anxiety, to reinforce their healthy drives, and to encourage them to continue in their struggle to change. As the central inner conflict rages, patients will oscillate between health and neurosis, but therapists must not become bewildered by these swings. If they have “a clear vision based on [their] own constructiveness” and are “unambiguous all[ies] of the endangered self, [they] will be able to support [their] patient[s] at this most trying time” (1999, p. 256).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The conflict between healthy and neurotic forces may never be finally resolved, but there may be a decisive shift in the balance of power. Therapy can be terminated when the balance has shifted decisively to the side of the strivings for growth and patients are ready to deal with their problems themselves through continuing self-analysis.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Horney’s belief in inherent constructive forces made her much more optimistic than Freud about the possibilities of psychotherapy. According to her, Freud did “not have any clear vision of constructive forces in man” and “had to deny their authentic character” (Horney, 1950, p. 378). For him, creativity and love were sublimated forms of libidinal drives, and a striving for self- fulfillment could only be regarded as “an expression of narcissistic libido” (1950, p. 378). For Horney, the goal of therapy was not to transform “hysterical misery into everyday unhappiness” (Breuer and Freud, 1936, p. 232) but to help people achieve the joy of self-realization.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Non-Clinical Applications of Horney\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Karen Horney’s theories have proven to be of value not only clinically but as an explanatory system that can be used in other disciplines.

One of the chief objections to the psychoanalytic study of character has been its reliance on infantile experience to account for the behavior of the adult, since such experience is rarely, if ever, presented in literature. But Horney’s theories focus on the kinds of adult defenses and inner conflicts about which literature often provides a great deal of information. In addition to being used in character study, Horney’s theories have been employed in the analysis of thematic inconsistencies, tensions between theme and characterization, the relation between authors and their works, and the psychology of reader response (see Paris 1974, 1978, 1986, 1989, 1991a, 1991b, 1991c). They have helped to illuminate works and authors not only from most periods of British and American literature, but also from ancient Greece and Rome, and from France, Russia, Germany, Spain, Norway, and Sweden in a variety of centuries.

Named official biographer twenty-four years before Frost died, Lawrance Thompson became aware of the poet’s many cruelties, self-contradictions, and inner conflicts. After completing a draft of his first volume, he read Neurosis and Human Growth and found in it the analytic concepts he needed to make sense of his bewildering subject. Had Horney’s book mentioned Frost on every page, Thompson wrote in his notebook, “it couldn’t have come closer to giving a psychological framework to what I’ve been trying to say” (Sheehy 1986, 398). He revised what he had written to reflect his new understanding of Frost as a man who developed a search for glory in response to early humiliations and who longed to triumph over and retaliate against those who had hurt him. Frost’s contradictory accounts of his life were a product of both his inner conflicts and his need to confirm his idealized image by mythologizing himself. Frost sometimes used his poetry to “escape from his confusions into idealized postures,” while at other times it served “as a means of striking back at, or of punishing” those he considered his enemies (Thompson, 1966, xix).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Cultural Study\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Several writers have used Horney in the analysis of culture. David M. Potter (1954) was particularly struck by her analysis of the character traits, inner conflicts, and vicious circles created by the competitiveness of American culture. We trade security for opportunity and then feel anxious and insecure. Paul Wachtel (1989, 1991) also argues that there is something compulsive, irrational, and self-defeating in the way Americans pursue an ever-increasing wealth. We promote competition rather than mutual support and behave aggressively in order to avoid being perceived as weak. James Huffman (1982) emphasizes the sense of threat and feelings of inferiority that have influenced the American character from the beginning of our history, resulting in a compensatory self-idealization and a search for national glory. We make exaggerated claims for ourselves and are outraged when they are not honored by other nations. Like Potter and Wachtel, Huffman sees the American character as predominantly aggressive. We like our leaders to be belligerent, and we glorify people who fight their way to the top. Bernard Paris (1986) has discussed Victorian culture from a Horneyan perspective and has correlated conflicting cultural codes found in Elizabeth culture (as reflected in Shakespeare’s plays) with Horney’s strategies of defense (1991a).\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Gender Study\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Horney has been rediscovered in recent years by feminists, many of whose positions she anticipated. Although most attention has been given to her early essays, her mature theory also has important implications for understanding gender identity and masculine and feminine psychology. Impressive work has been done along these lines by Alexandra Symonds, a Horneyan analyst, and Marcia Westkott, a social psychologist.

In every case the starting point was a culture that conditioned girls to be self-effacing and dependent, while boys were encouraged to be autonomous and aggressive. While focusing on the plight of girls, Symonds recognized that boys develop difficulties of their own as a result of cultural stereotyping.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In The Feminist Legacy of Karen Horney (1986), Marcia Westkott explored the implications of Horney’s mature theory for feminine psychology, with chapters on the sexualization and devaluation of women and the dependency, anger, and detachment they feel as a consequence. In addition, she developed a Horneyan critique of a major strand of feminist theory. Jean Baker Miller, Nancy Chodorow, Carol Gilligan, and the Stone Center group associate an array of personality traits specifically with women. These include a need for affiliation, a nurturing disposition, a sense of responsibility for other people, and a relational sense of identity. Westkott observed that although these traits are regarded in a positive way, they emerged from “a historical setting in which women are less highly valued than men” (Westkott, 1986, p. 2). She proposed that these traits are defensive reactions to subordination, devaluation, and powerlessness and that, however desirable they may seem from a social point of view, they are inimical to women’s self-actualization. Westkott thus demythified the celebration of female relationality, arguing that is has provided “a contemporary theoretical justification for traditionally idealized femininity” (Westkott, 1989, p. 245). She contended, with Horney, that being deprived is not ennobling but damaging and that the self-effacing qualities many women develop in order to cope with devaluation are destructive.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Evaluation\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Karen Horney is important for her contributions to feminine psychology, which were forgotten for many years but have been highly influential since their republication in Feminine Psychology in 1967. They are especially notable for their exploration of female development from a woman’s point of view and for their emphasis on the cultural construction of gender. Unlike her essays on feminine psychology, Horney’s first two books had a great impact in their day, and their case for the importance of culture and for a structural model of neurosis continues to have an influence. The growing emphasis on present-oriented therapies owes something to Horney’s teachings. Her third book, Self-Analysis (1942), inspired the Institute for Self Analysis in London and is still the most thorough discussion of the possibilities and techniques of successful self-exploration. It should be noted that Horney felt that self-analysis has the best chance of success when it is employed in conjunction with therapy or as a way of continuing to work on oneself after termination.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"While each stage of Horney’s thought is important, her mature theory represents her most significant contribution. Most of Horney’s early ideas have been revised or enriched — by Horney herself or by others — or have been absorbed or discovered anew by later writers. This is not the case with her mature theory. Our Inner Conflicts (1945) and Neurosis and Human Growth (1950) provide explanations of human behavior in terms of currently existing constellations of defenses and inner conflicts that can be found nowhere else. Horney does not account for the whole of human psychology, since like every theorist she describes only part of the picture, but her mature theory is highly congruent with frequently occurring patterns of behavior. Although Horney objected to the instinctivistic nature of Freudian theory, her own theory has a biological basis, since the movements against, away from, and toward other people are human elaborations of the basic defenses of the animal kingdom — fight, flight, and submission. All the strategies are encoded in almost every culture; but each culture has its characteristic attitudes toward the different strategies, its own formulations of and variations upon them, and its own structure of inner conflicts. Horney is often thought of as having described the neurotic personality of her time, but, as its interdisciplinary uses show, her mature theory has wide applicability.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Conclusion\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Most psychoanalytic theory has followed Freud in focusing on early origins as a means of explanation and therapy. Well in advance of many recent critics of psychoanalysis, Karen Horney felt that this practice results in circular reasoning, in the conversion of analogies into causes, and in a variety of other epistemological problems. She also felt it to be therapeutically ineffective. Horney doubted that early childhood could ever be accurately recovered, since we are bound to reconstruct it from the perspective of our present needs, beliefs, and defenses. We have a natural desire to explain things in terms of their origins, but Horney felt that there are as many myths of origin as there are psychoanalytic theories. It is more profitable, she argued, “to focus on the forces which actually drive and inhibit a person; there is a reasonable chance of understanding these, even without much knowledge of childhood” (Horney, 1939, p. 146). Horney tried to explain behavior in terms of its function within the current constellation of defenses and to account for contradictory attitudes, actions, and beliefs by seeing them as part of a structure of inner conflicts.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Karen Horney is perhaps the first humanistic psychoanalyst. Her theories are entirely compatible with those of Abraham Maslow, who was influenced by her. Both theories are based on the idea of a “real self” that it is the object of life to actualize. Horney focused on what happens when we become alienated from our real selves as a result of a pathogenic environment, while Maslow focused on what we require for healthy growth and the characteristics of self-actualizing people. Horney describes the defensive strategies we employ when our healthy basic needs for safety, love and belonging, and esteem have been turned into insatiable neurotic needs as a result of having been thwarted.
