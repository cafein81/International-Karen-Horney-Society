I have participated in seminars, symposia, and round tables in which I have tried to make Greek psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers aware of different aspects of Horney theory. I am interested in politics, social psychology, ecology, etc. I am an active member of the \"Movement of Self-Consciousness and Self-Protection,\" located here in Patras, which has as its goal the application of self-development techniques in order to prevent cruelty, aggression, destructiveness, and war. I wrote a book in Greek analyzing war and destructiveness from the perspective of social psychology in 1989. I am particularly interested in exploring Ghandi's technique of passive resistance in social and political matters.\"</P>\n        </v-card>\n      </v-flex>\n      <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n        <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n          <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Helen Papathanassopoulou</v-card-title>\n          <br />\n          <p>Voutsina 77-79, Holargos, 15561 Athens.
