J. Paris. At a time when I was reading the novels of Anita Desai (an Indo-English novelist) and was trying to find a suitable approach, Horney's theory attracted me immediately. Using Horney, I wrote a dissertation on Anita Desai that was subsequently published in India as a book; and I then spent two terms at the University of Florida doing post-doctoral work with Dr. Paris. I am proud to say that I am the first person to take up the Horneyan approach in India, and I wish to continue my efforts to introduce Horney to Indian scholars. I am currently working on a book to be entitled The Psychological Novels of William Golding, and I hope in future to work on Indo-English Literature and Horney. I shall be reading a paper entitled \"Anita Desai's Where Shall We Go This Summer? and Margaret Atwood's Surfacing--a Horneyan Approach,\" at a forthcoming seminar of the Indian Society for Commonwealth Studies.\"</p>\n          </v-card>\n        </v-flex>\n        <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n          <v-card class=\"long-card\" height=\"320px\">\n            <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Mrs. Rama Gupta, M.A., M.

I feel, however, that Horney should be available in India so that Indian scholars could easily get her books.
