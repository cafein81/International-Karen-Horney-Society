Tel. 617-267-0336</p>\n          <p>\"I have graduated medicine in Bulgaria. The need to improve my education led me to the reading of psychoanalytic literature. The ideas of Karen Horney can be applied in different countries, and her introduction of self-analysis as a supporting method would significantly facilitate the training of psychoanalysts from the former East European countries. Reading her essays strongly influenced my wish to specialize in psychiatry in the U.S. I came to this country recently and am now in the process of preparing for the exams necessary for getting into a residency. I shall be glad to contact analysts whose work is based on Horney's ideas. At present I live in Boston and would like to meet analysts working in this region. I am also available for international communication. I speak French, English, some German, and, as a Bulgarian, I am fluent in Russian. In East European countries there is still a considerable deficit regarding psychoanalytic literature. I would be glad to help with the translation and publishing of Horney's works abroad.\"</p>\n        </v-card>\n      </v-flex>\n      <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n        <v-layout row wrap>\n          <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n            <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n              <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Eric W.

Her account of the masochist's seemingly excessive suffering as an attempt to dissolve the boundaries of the self is helpful in explaining the controversial ending of Bellow's novel. I am working on a Ph.D. in English at the University of Florida and I also plan on training as an analyst. I would be interested in learning about psychoanalytic institutes around the world that are open to the training of lay analysts and use the ideas of Horney and Erich Fromm as guiding theories.\"</p>\n            </v-card>\n          </v-flex>\n        </v-layout>\n      </v-flex>\n      <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n        <v-layout row wrap>\n          <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n            <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n              <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Arnaldo Apolito, M.D.</v-card-title>\n              <br />\n              <p>(U. of Naples)</p>\n              <p>80 Undercliff Road, Montclair, NJ 07042.

She was my faculty advisor and a key person in my development as a person and as a psychoanalyst. She was indeed a great lady and I thoroughly enjoyed putting together the commemorative issue of The American Journal of Psychoanalysis (Fall, 1991) and the Conference to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of her founding of the Institute, the Association, and the seeds for the Karen Horney Clinic (see the 1955 Karen Horney Foundation Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 1, which I edited).\"</p>\n              <p>The proceeding of the above mentioned conference have been published as Women Beyond Freud: New Concepts of Feminine Psychology, ed.

Fellow of American Academy of Psychoanalysis. Private Practice.</p>\n              <p>\"I became interested in psychoanalysis while doing my psychiatric residency and eventually obtained analytic training by commuting between Phoenix and Los Angeles for about six years. As my analyst trained in New York with a Horneyan institute, I became interested in Horney's work. I have become active in the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, and I have presented papers to the Academy on the negative therapeutic reaction, the stories of Hans Christian Andersen, and the mythology of vampires. I have a private practice in psychiatry and psychoanalysis and teach part-time in a psychiatric residency. Along with a small group of colleagues, I am working to establish an interdisciplinary training program in psychoanalytic psychotherapy in our area (the Southwest Center for Psychoanalytic Studies).\"</p>\n            </v-card>\n          </v-flex>\n        </v-layout>\n      </v-flex>\n      <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n        <v-layout row wrap>\n          <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n            <v-card class=\"long-card\" height=\"350px\">\n              <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Bernard G.

Institutional affiliations: University of Chicago, De Paul University, Northwestern University (Institute for Learning in Retirement).</p>\n              <p>\"Karen Horney is unique among psychoanalysts because she has written at length about the feasibility and desirability of self-analysis. I believe that I have gained an insight into this process that is both profound and unique, in part because I am not a psychological professional. I have earned my livelihood as a lawyer. I am interested in how self-analysis has benefitted me and can benefit others who are similarly endowed and needy.</p>\n              <p>What I call 'psychoanalytic literacy' is analogous to language literacy. A person who know how to read and write has been given a technique for self-improvement that has been in the forefront of advancing civilization and has begun a journey that lasts his whole life. So it can be with psychoanalytic literacy. Just as language literacy required a long period of development to arrive at the role it now plays in civilization, so it is probable that the same is the destiny of psychoanalysis. Today barely a century old, it is an idea before its time. We can only conjecture as to how long it will take to fulfill its destiny. But it appears evident to me that the IKHS can provide an opportunity for advancing the cause, and that is why it pleases me to become a member.\"</p>\n            </v-card>\n          </v-flex>\n        </v-layout>\n      </v-flex>\n      <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n        <v-layout row wrap>\n          <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n            <v-card class=\"long-card\" height=\"330px\">\n              <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Bettee F.

I am interested in the meaning of this concept from various perspectives--such as the personal meanings it held for Horney herself, the development of its meanings and theoretical role in her theories, its uses in her therapeutic approach. I explore also Horney's development of the meanings of the experienced real self or of being oneself--for instance, of wholeheartedness, of being in the present moment--and the relation of this development to her interest in Zen. My work examines connections between the evolutionary process of the idea of the real self and Karen Horney's creative process in working out her philosophy, theories, concepts, and therapeutic approach. Another focus of my interest is how the development and underpinnings of Horney's later work are related to her early work in feminine psychology.\"</p>\n              <P>Work address: Women's Psychotherapy Centre of Wisconsin, 16 N.

Because Horney explains so many of us, and because the data relevant to character structure is more readily accessible than data on sexual functioning, etc., such works are often greeted as more 'balanced' than most psychobiographies. But because the analysis often strikes so close to home for many of us, it is sometimes blatantly misinterpreted and dismissed as 'psycho-baloney.'\"</p>\n            </v-card>\n          </v-flex>\n        </v-layout>\n      </v-flex>\n      <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n        <v-layout row wrap>\n          <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n            <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n              <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Robin Steier Goldberg, Ph.D.</v-card-title>\n              <br />\n              <p>(Clinical Psychology, Fordham U)</p>\n              <p>1349 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10128.

Americans for the most part have lived in a threatening environment and have responded both individually and collectively with a clear search for glory, formation of idealized selves, and most often an expansive strategy for coping with life. The book traces this pattern in popular culture from movies to comic strips, in politics from Presidents to popular votes, in cultural institutions such as religion and business, and in history from the revolution to the present. Examples of individuals (such as Kennedy and Johnson in politics, Kirk Douglas and Marilyn Monroe in film) and of groups (such as the Mormons and political and economic bureaucracies), as well as historical and cultural trends, are used to support the basic argument.\"</p>\n              <p>Recent essay: \"A Horneyan Approach to American Literature,\" in Dionysus in Literature: Essays on Literary Madness, ed.

I like Horney's optimism, her approach to cure, and her ideas about the solutions a person adopts in response to cultural and interpersonal pressures. She consistently reminds the reader of the importance of compassion and openness in the treatment of patients.\"</p>\n            </v-card>\n          </v-flex>\n        </v-layout>\n      </v-flex>\n      <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n        <v-layout row wrap>\n          <v-flex d-flex xs12>\n            <v-card class=\"long-card\">\n              <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Constance A.
