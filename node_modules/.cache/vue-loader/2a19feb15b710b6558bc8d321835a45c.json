From the Introduction: 'A psychoanalytic study, using the insights and tools of Karen Horney's method it examines Adolf Hitler as a frustrated, failed artist. Yet the essay is not bogged down in so-called psychobabble and does not truck out the tired old Freudian cliche of the artist as neurotic (or in this case: psychotic) who externalizes into public symptoms the inner turmoil of his soul. That would trivialize the figure of Hitler and the enormity of his crimes. There is a more psychohistorical perspective at work.' \"</p>\n        <p>(book description provided on Amazon.com)</p>\n      </v-flex>\n    </v-layout>\n  </v-container>\n  <Footer />\n</div>\n",null]}
