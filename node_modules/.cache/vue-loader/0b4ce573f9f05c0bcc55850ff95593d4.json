Paris, Ph.D., and Helen De Rosis,\n                  M.D. Bernard Paris has been the Society's director since its inception. The objectives of the Society have been to\n                  put people interested in Horney in touch with each other, to keep members informed of developments in Horney theory and\n                  Horney studies, and to call Horney's contribution to the attention of those who may not be familiar with it.\n                </v-card-text>\n                \n              </v-card>\n            </v-flex>\n          </v-layout>\n        </v-flex>\n      </v-layout>\n    </v-container>\n    <v-container>\n      <v-layout>\n        <v-flex xs12 class=\"text\">\n          <v-card-title class=\"titl\">More Information</v-card-title>\n          <v-card-text class=\"cont\">\n                  In the first half-dozen years of its existence, the IKHS facilitated these objectives by distributing an\n                  informative membership directory, publishing a Bulletin, and holding meetings and conferences. International conferences\n                  were held in New York in 1993 and Rome in 1994, and there were other meetings of a more local nature. In 1995, the\n                  IKHS conducted a four day seminar on \"Karen Horney's Theory and Its Applications in Science and Clinical Practice\" at\n                  the East European Institute of Psychoanalysis in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Society has sponsored translations of\n                  Horney's works into Russian and Chinese and has assisted those working with Horney in various parts of the world,\n                  including South Korea.\n                </v-card-text>\n          <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Current Activities</v-card-title>\n\n          <v-card-text class=\"cont\">\n            2016 marks the 25th anniversary since the founding of the International Karen Horney Society in 1991 by\n            Prof. Bernard J. Paris. 2016 also marks the 75th anniversary since the founding of the American Institute\n            for Psychoanalysis in 1941 by Dr. Karen Horney. One of the goals of the IKHS this year is to take stock of\n            recent and ongoing developments related to Horney’s theory and works. Another is to show connections between\n            her psychodynamic theory with computer science and the model of the mind that have been brought to light by Dr.\n            Andrew N. Tershakovec (1921–2007). A third goal is to identify how Horneyan theory can be placed in systematic\n            relation to the theory of dreaming consciousness of Dr. J. Allan Hobson.\n          </v-card-text>\n          <v-card-text class=\"cont\">\n            Since 1997, the Society has continued to sponsor translations and to facilitate the study of Horney in countries\n            where materials have been hard to obtain, but it has stopped holding conferences, adding new members, collecting\n            dues, and issuing reports, bulletins, and membership directories. In 2001, the IKHS entered a new phase of activity\n            with the establishment of this website. The objectives of the website are those the Society was originally formed\n            to implement: to help those interested in Horney to become aware of each other, to inform people of developments\n            in Horney studies, and to help people learn about Horney's ideas.\n          </v-card-text>\n\n          <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Membership</v-card-title>\n          <v-card-text class=\"cont\">\n            The IKHS no longer formally enrolls members or collects dues, but anyone wishing to be added to the membership\n            directory should send an e-mail to bjparis@ufl.edu with pertinent information, and his or her entry will be added\n            when this website is next updated. Those who are already in the membership directory posted here, which was current\n            as of 1995, may update their entry via e-mail. Visitors to this website are also invited to contribute to the\n            Bulletin Board, which contains notices pertinent to Horney studies and which will be updated periodically.\n          </v-card-text>\n\n          <v-card-title class=\"h4\">Director</v-card-title>\n          <v-card-text class=\"cont\">\n            Anthony K.

He has written and edited\n            more than a dozen books on literary criticism, almost all of these employing the theory of Karen Horney. He has\n            also written a biography of Karen Horney (Karen Horney: A Psychoanalyst’s Search for Self-Understanding, New Haven\n            and London: Yale University Press, 1994) and edited two books from Horney’s previously-unpublished works: The\n            Therapeutic Process: Essays and Lectures, YUP, 1999, and The Unknown Karen Horney: Essays on Gender, Culture,\n            and Psychoanalysis, YUP, 2000.
