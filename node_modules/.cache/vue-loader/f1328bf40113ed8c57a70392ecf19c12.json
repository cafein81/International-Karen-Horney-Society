Does the fact that each threatens the status of the other help to explain the intensity of their hatred and rage? Is their vindictiveness a response to being threatened, an effort to repair the injury they feel they've sustained? This seems to be the case for Satan, but must not God also have felt deeply hurt to have such a powerful need for vengeance? If so, why is the Almighty so vulnerable? And why is he so hard on Adam and Eve and the rest of humankind?

Instead of looking through the characters to the author, Paris looks at Milton's characters as objects of interest in themselves, as creations inside a creation who escape their thematic roles and are embodiments of his psychological intuitions. This book heightens our appreciation of an ignored aspect of Milton's art and offers new insights into the critical controversies that have surrounded Paradise Lost.\"\n                  )\n                ]),\n                _c(\"p\", [_vm._v(\"(book description provided on Amazon.com)\")]),\n                _c(\"p\", [\n                  _vm._v(\n                    \"Transaction Publishers has also reissued reprints of Paris's first two books applying a Horneyan approach to literary criticism: A Psychological Approach to Fiction (1974/2010), with a new introduction by the author; and Character and Conflict in Jane Austen's Novels (1978/2013).\"\n                  )\n                ])\n              ])\n            ],\n            1\n          )\n        ],\n        1\n      ),\n      _c(\"Footer\")\n    ],\n    1\n  )\n}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\nrender._withStripped = true\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }"]}
