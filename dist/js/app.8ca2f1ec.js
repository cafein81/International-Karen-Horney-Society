The interpersonal strategies involve moving toward, against, or away from\n          other people and adopting a self-effacing, expansive, or resigned solution.

(completed 1999) explored the experience of students taking my creative writing course 'Autobiography and the Imagination', some of whom derived therapeutic benefit from fictionalising themselves, their experience and significant people in their lives. I made extensive use of the theories of Karen Horney in analysing the material that arose out of this research and found these theories particularly helpful in understanding the difficulties that some of these students experienced in creating fictional characters based on themselves. These difficulties I interpreted as arising out of inner conflicts between different 'life solutions', in the Horneyan sense. I saw the writing of fictional autobiography as a means of provoking a 'metaphorical confrontation' with these conflicts that facilitated a deeper emotional understanding of them and hence therapeutic benefit. Against this background, I then explored, using Horney's theories and the literary critical work of Bernard Paris that draws on them, the possibility that fictional autobiography might be used as a means of self-therapy.

Since it is so important, the question might well be raised, is it possible to overemphasize or overrate love? Does not the danger lie rather in underrating its importance? Would not the world be a far better place in which to live if people loved more? Might this not be the answer to the age-old problem of how to eliminate war and other forms of human strife? And then there are the children — is it possible for them to have too much love?

Nevertheless, if we expect of love what it cannot give, or anticipate its benefits under faulty circumstances, it will not grow. Nor can it possibly be of true service to us. This at bottom is a banal truth and applies not only to love. When, for instance, we plant strawberry seeds, we do not expect apples to grow, nor do we expect the plants to lay eggs, provide shade, or produce wood for the fireplace. All good things need cultivating. To get strawberries, we must plant the seeds properly, in the right kind of soil, supplying the moisture, sun, and shade required by this particular type of plant. Later, we would have to re-plant the young shoots when they have reached the right stage of development, and tend them continuously. That we do not see these relations as clearly in love has to do with love being less tangible, less concrete than strawberries. Therefore we can more easily harbor illusions on this score.")]),a("p",[e._v("Let us ask now, how can we discover whether we overemphasize love or whether somebody else does. It is not an easy task. However, for all practical purposes, it can be assumed that some of our longing for love is normal. But it is essential that we be on the alert to observe, and to analyze, every element in it that is of a compulsive nature, for it is precisely this compulsive aspect that denotes a neurotic exploitation of love. An irrational attitude toward love is revealed, for instance, in the rather frequent assumption that it is only “natural,” especially for a woman, to be desperate if a fiancé does not call or write, or for a woman to go to pieces if her husband goes out with another woman, or for a woman to claim all her husband’s or lover’s time, even begrudging him a natural interest in his business.")]),a("p",[e._v("Throughout this lecture, I shall speak in terms of the woman who overemphasizes love because such an attitude is not only encouraged, but exaggerated by our culture. It is, however, not a problem which has to do essentially with femininity. It may concern men as well. In general, we can gauge the degree of dependency upon love by observing the position it occupies in the total scheme of our lives. If, for instance, all our interests, desires, plans, and fears revolve around love, our days will be filled with, and our minds occupied by, such fruitless questions as, “Why doesn’t he write oftener?”; “Will he come home early this evening?”; “Why doesn’t he call?”; “How much does he really love me?” It can easily be understood that as a consequence of this desperate constriction of our energies and interests, all else in life becomes meaningless, and that time’s passage is made memorable merely by the punctuated silence occasioned by the ringing of the phone or doorbell, which inevitably is followed by a frantic question, “Is it he?” Obviously there is no room in such life for mere friends, or for productive work. These people, being thus dependent on love, often have plenty of neurotic troubles, like feeling tense, having fears, inhibitions, timidities, et cetera. In analysis, we can observe that all of life[’s] problems — that they believe that all of life[’s] problems would be magically solved for them if only they had the right husband or lover.")]),a("p",[e._v("Another way to discover a neurotic attitude towards love is to observe the reactions of deep despair and depression occasioned by any slight frustration in the realm of love. People who exhibit such extreme reactions — quite out of proportion to the real significance of a situation — feel desolate when not in the company of their partners, and are irreparably humiliated by any form of neglect, irrespective of extenuating circumstances. And when such people ask themselves, “why doesn’t he write,” what is actually implied by their query is the blindly insistent injunction “he should write,” or “he would write if he really loved me.” Also implied, of course, is the neurotic assumption, “if he really loved me — as I love him — then nothing else, no one else, could possibly be more important to him at any time. In any instance, whether it is this extreme dependency on the partner, there is a frenzied clinging that is not only degrading but that inevitably fosters a terror of being deserted. As a result, the entire relationship is disturbed. And when the partner, too, is neurotic, the malady is considerably aggravated by the operation of externally conflicting trends. Thus, for instance, a detached partner might well be exasperated by such persistent encroachments upon his precious isolation. A sadistic partner, on the other hand, would be inclined to misuse and exploit the dependency. These, then, are the features that characterize a neurotic overemphasis on love. In any normal love relationship, some of them may be present.")]),a("p",[e._v("But if the entire character structure presents evidence of the existence of all of these symptoms, the condition is of a decidedly harmful nature. For inevitably, the effects are crippling to the entire personality, in addition to causing acute suffering. People vary considerably, both in their comprehension of, and their response to this neurotic symptom in themselves. Those who do not understand its significance consider their behavior completely natural. Others, sensing a deficiency, are inclined to place the responsibility outside of themselves. Life, they claim, has offered them nothing but bad breaks. They are certain that everything would be fine if only the right person came along. This mythical being, presumably, would have to be a de-personalized paragon of devotion, very really to satisfy the exorbitant claims made upon him.")]),a("p",[e._v("But there are others, who have a clear realization of their state of dependency, and who earnestly desire to liberate themselves. They have become acutely aware of the havoc wrought, not only upon their personality, but upon their entire life. For them, the problem is how to cope with this excessive need for love. They must question their deepest, most fundamental expectations of love. In doing so, they may first discover that their extreme dependency upon it is partly due to a rather constant fear of hostility on the part of others. This was illustrated by a patient who brought in a picture she had drawn in which she had portrayed herself as an infant, surrounded by menacing animals and insects — a bull, a cat, and a bee — all threatening the infant’s life. This picture was an unconscious revelation of her real and basic fear of people. To her, they appeared strange and menacing, and in their presence she felt infantile in her helplessness to cope with them in any kind of human relationship. It is understandable, therefore, why such a woman depends so much upon her husband or lover. Not for love, but rather, because of her need for acceptance and security.")]),a("p",[e._v("Love has a reassurance value for those who overemphasize it precisely because they themselves feel so defenseless. Consequently, they regard their partners essentially as allies against a hostile world. This becomes evident, for instance, when a woman insists that her husband make arrangements with the landlord for household repairs. She may even go so far as to expect him to assert his authority when the maid becomes difficult. In general, she counts upon him to defend her against others, including, for instance, her own relatives.")]),a("p",[e._v("Are we to understand, now, that such people are by nature inclined to be too soft? Or altogether lacking in self-assertiveness? This may not be so at all. As a matter of fact, they frequently do reveal a certain degree of aggressiveness, although indirectly. For without being aware of it, they may haunt their partners by their clinging, or by constantly demonstrating their disappointment and misery. They seem to be afraid, though, to be aggressive, and act as if they had neither spunk nor initiative. They lean over backwards to be agreeable, and frequently are apologetic, as well as too yielding, or too appeasing. At the same time, however, they smart beneath the burden of the subordinate role in which they have placed themselves. A wife who makes exclusive claims upon love looks upon her husband as the mainstay of her existence. She expects him to be not only an adequate provider, but an effective intermediary between her and all life situations. Thus she manages to protect herself from the hazards of asserting her insecure self or of making faulty decisions. She may even persuade herself into the conviction that his love must have endowed him with a sensitivity expressly attuned to her unexpressed wishes. And, inevitably, she regards herself as winsomely helpless and fragile. In view of all these things, it is only natural, therefore, that such a woman frequently is attracted to an aggressive man. Aware of her own lack, she desires resourcefulness in her partner. More important, even, she feels that with a strong or aggressive partner, she can remain safe in her weakness. Unfortunately, despite the undeniable shrewdness of her logic, this course is destined to perpetuate her malady.")]),a("p",[e._v("Overemphasis on love is revealed, also, in those who depend upon the love and admiration of others to bolster up their self-confidence. The state of their morale is determined pretty much by the amount and degree of devotion and admiration that surround them. In the absence of such bolstering, their basic feeling of insignificance leads them to become hypercritical of themselves, since they lack the sense of security that is essential to accurate and dependable self-evaluation. Others take inordinate pride in their partner’s achievements, simply because they are able to bask in the warm glow of reflected glory. However, theirs is a worn and limp sort of existence. For they have succeeded merely in living vicariously. The emotionally dead, as well as those whose feelings have been consistently and rigidly repressed that they have become inaccessible to normal stimuli, nevertheless look to a love relationship for the emotional warmth and vitality that they so sadly lack and need. No longer able to tap their own resources, they are lured away from their own shortcomings and stimulated into a pseudo- sort of well-being and self-confidence by an ebullient partner. The myth-makers of old showed a discerning observation of this aspect of love dependency in their narratives about the old man or woman who felt more alive after sleeping with a youthful person. Strangely enough, these people labor under the illusion that it is really possible to acquire vitality from others, much in the manner in which plants absorb nourishment from the soil.")]),a("p",[e._v("Yet even plants have to make something of what they absorb. It would seem, then, that these people have consigned themselves to a parasitical state in life. To sustain and fortify their illusions, they are strongly inclined to endow love with truly magical powers and qualities. Like Cinderella in the fairy-tale, or like Madame Bovary, in Flaubert’s realistic delineation of a romantic attachment, they regard love as an ‘open sesame’ to fantastically happy living, and under its miraculous aegis, they confidently hope to acquire all that which they lack — strength, assurance, warmth, and magnetism — in short, a completely rounded vision of happiness. But the outcome is always the same. Their dreams, their illusions, their fantasies eventually become like leaden weights that strangulate the beloved. In summary, we may say that people who are alienated from themselves, who are possessed of neurotic fears, and who are incapable of utilizing their own resources, are compelled to live through others. Their predicament is due largely to an aversion against changing themselves in any way, and to their subsequent dependence upon miraculous and external solutions. Because they cannot cope with life as it is, they escape into an idealized realm wherein love, devotion, and sacrifice are glorified, and make the principal activating forces in the lives of others. For them, however, love remains illusory. They are incapable of giving it; hence, incapable of receiving it.")]),a("p",[e._v("Let us consider, now, what we must be and do, if we expect to reap the benefits of love. Such fulfillment can be achieved only if we ourselves have the capacity for love and are willing to make the necessary personal adjustments essential to its proper utilization. Those who are neurotically dependent upon love are too often disposed to disregard their own responsibilities. Despite their deification of love as the only worthwhile thing in life, it never occurs to them to question their own qualifications as active participants or deserving recipients. They are far more inclined to take love for granted. Although it is my belief that everyone is endowed with the potential capacity for love, nevertheless experience teaches that all the fears, weaknesses, pretenses, and excessive demands that many of us make upon love deprive us of its eventual fulfillments. My convictions concerning our inherent potentialities have been fortified considerably by my analytical experience. I have seen people, liberated from constricting fears and inhibitions, become more realistic in their attitude toward love. This indicates that their emotional capacities have been successfully tapped and their love impulses effectively channeled. Obviously, this could not have been achieved had the patient been inherently lacking in this capacity, for it is not within the power of the analyst to instill in the patient what was not already present.")]),a("p",[e._v("It would be pertinent at this point to inquire of ourselves why we so rarely consider our own capacities and qualifications as lovers. Might not the answer be that in our culture, we are inclined to confuse equality with capacity, or to assume that opportunity in itself denotes fulfillment? Thus we assume, for instance, that everyone is equally capable of being a good mother, a good lover, or a good citizen in a democracy. How valid are these assumptions? Let us limit ourselves for the time being to the sphere of love, since that is our particular interest for the moment. Isn’t it true that many of us deliberately avoid analyzing our capacities as lovers? And might not be the reason that we are fearful of losing our illusions about ourselves? Instead, we exert all our effort and ingenuity in preserving the grand illusion that we are great lovers. Perhaps nothing in our present culture reveals this better than our fondness for the movies. For does not the popularity of this entertainment medium derive largely from our neurotic propensity towards identifying ourselves with the ideal lover in his successful exploits, or with the femme fatale whose repose will absorb the worship of her lovers, like a flower raised towards the sun?")]),a("p",[e._v("On the other hand, to some the mere idea of love is appealing that they make neurotic attempts to appear lovable, and engage in unconscious strategies to win approval and admiration, but in their avid quest for love, they characteristically overlook its basic qualifications: friendliness, loyalty, considerateness, warmth. Instead, they refashion themselves to become merely appeasing, docile, ingratiating, and abjectly diffident. Because they mistake their unconscious strategies for the real thing, they delude themselves into thinking that they are blessed with an exceptional loving nature.")]),a("p",[e._v("Let us review, now, the factors that commonly interfere with the capacity to love and that subsequently lead to failure in any close relationship. To begin with, neurotic people are too self-centered, and consequently evaluate a partner in terms of their own needs. Possessed of a false sense of their own worth, they find it difficult, perhaps impossible, to give themselves. Also, their constant fear of self-disclosure compels them to retreat behind a façade of hypothetical virtues, which gradually they incorporate into a spurious reality. Furthermore, neurotic individuals are too vulnerable and too easily hurt because of their excessive expectations. Since their neurotic conflicts compel them to create their magnificent illusions about themselves, they are easily humiliated by the uninitiated who do not share the secret of their uniqueness. And, living so much in the world of their imagination, they eventually lose touch with their own reality as well as with the reality of their close associates. Finally, those who overemphasize love jeopardize their chances for its fulfillment because they are so unaware of the excessive demands that they make. Dwelling in their imagination, they feel entitled to expectations on a fantastic scale. In view of these attitudes, it is easy to understand why neurotic people regard the so-called ‘unconditional love’ as the ideal state of being. Seen from the vantage point of the partner, however, this neurotic ideal actually means ‘unconditional surrender.’ Imbued with the knowledge of their own insufficiency, they are obliged to cast about for devious and subtle ways of commanding the devotion and admiration that are so necessary to them.")]),a("p",[e._v("The analytic situation clearly reveals what happens to the neurotic person who has come to regard love as a panacea for all the difficulties ensuing from his unresolved conflicts. This attitude is especially well illustrated in the instances of some women patients who confidently declare to their male analysts, “If you would only love me, all my problems would be solved.” Clearly and definitely, they do not wish to be analyzed. Much less do they wish to alter themselves in any way. They grant the desirability of change and adjustments in the general scheme of things, but the general activity, they assume, must proceed from the outside. Circumstances should be improved; the analyst should do the work; other people should do the adjusting. Being driven within themselves by inner, egocentric compulsions, they can appreciate emotions and events only in terms of their own isolated and distorted values.")]),a("p",[e._v("It was Freud’s contention that such people are biologically so constituted as to require sexual gratification beyond the needs of the average person. This view predicated a fatalistic outlook for the patient, leaving him the hopeless and unhappy victim of his abnormal physiological makeup. It is my opinion, however, that this is not really the case. For in analysis, such unhappy situations eventually reveal themselves to be of distinctly neurotic — rather than physiological — origin. Over and over again, they tell the sad tale of dependency, of the escape from reality, and of the fantastic expectation that love will triumph over all obstacles and solve all problems. Implied in the classical Greek definition of tragedy is the conviction that man is forever subjected to, and controlled by, the idle caprices of sterner wills of the gods. In this light, too, should we understand the tragedy that encompasses the lives of those neurotic people who worship at the shrine of love. They cannot know love’s fulfillment because, like the characters in a Greek tragedy, their fortunes and their reverses are constantly at the mercy of their own exploitive drives for a security that forever remains a will-of-the-wisp. Such people have not love, nor have they lived.")]),a("p",[e._v("Even if they regarded love as one of the crucial factors in neurosis, Freud and his followers have given insufficient consideration to the meaning of this phenomenon. They were content to regard love — in whatever context it appeared — as some manifestation of the sex instinct. Actually, the desire to be loved, appreciated, or admired plays a powerful role in neurosis. As I tried to show in my book The Neurotic Personality of Our Time [1937], the intensity and pervasiveness of this craving are, in large part, the result of an underlying fear of people. The neurotic need for affection is an attempt to allay such fear. But even more than that, it is an attempt to remedy a poignant incapacity to accept oneself. For, indeed, these self-impose inferiority or guilt feelings are a heavy burden to bear. In the process of every analysis, we see how frequently the neurotic turns against himself, frustrating and berating himself in a manner that is clearly sadistic. Recently, I have seen some excellent illustrations of just such behavior. After attending a lecture, a patient had left with some very stimulating ideas of his own. In fact, the enthusiasm of the moment inspired him to consider developing his ideas along literary lines. Immediately, however, the cynical voice of self-contempt cried out, “You conceited fool! You think you can write?” In another patient, revealed itself through internal dialogue. Thus, confidently, he thinks, “Thank goodness! Tonight, I shall sleep my head off,” while that other voice snidely remarks, “Oh no you won’t.” These are but a few examples — which I could easily multiply by the hundred — which illustrate how, mostly without knowing it, the neurotic constantly frustrates himself as well as the very people who love him. Co-existent with corrosive self-contempt is the neurotic’s pathetic dependence upon the opinions, admiration, and love of others. His argument is, “If I am loved by somebody, then I cannot be so bad. I must really amount to something.” Obviously, the dependence upon the approval of everyone makes a neurotic extremely vulnerable, because if he feels rejected, or is rejected, then his falsely gained, spurious self-esteem drops immediately to zero. In this way, the need to love, or to be loved, may become compulsive. There is nothing voluntary about such love. It is prompted by dire necessity.")]),a("p",[e._v("The question arises: Since neurotic love is in a sense compulsive, has it therefore no redeeming virtues? This question may appear strange coming from me, inasmuch as I have so often talked about the detrimental effects of the compulsive need for love — how we are disappointed in it, and how it affects others; how such love is lacking in real warmth; its incapacity to allay our fears, or to help us to live in peace with ourselves. All of this is quite true, and I retract none of it. Yet I wonder whether, even in this neurotic distortion, love does not retain some of its inherent constructive power. I would not have raised this question were I not familiar with a certain type of patient in whose life love apparently plays no role.")]),a("p",[e._v("I am thinking, for instance, of a patient whose neurotic structure necessitated the absolute exclusion of love. He had a mother, an older sister and brothers, all of whom treated him sadistically. In fact, there was almost no love in their relationships to him. Inevitably, he became a neurotic person — a person who expected only hostility from others. Furthermore, in the course of the evolution of his neurosis, he developed a hatred for himself, a need to turn against himself, to tear himself apart in a sadistic way. This self-destructive impulse was so dangerous for him that it necessitated the adoption of defensive attitudes of arrogance and self-righteousness. As a result, he constantly courted hostility with his pontifical conviction, “I am always right! It is the others who are wrong.” He could maintain this conviction of unsullied rectitude only, however, at the expense of all human feelings. Thus, other people acting in a friendly manner toward one another frightened him. To defend himself, he had to consider as neurotic all expressions of mutuality and congeniality. Even so, with a defiance bristling with bitterness, we would proclaim, cynically, “There is no such thing as real goodness.”")]),a("p",[e._v("This patient developed what I would call the ‘closed system’ — one which would brook no interference from the outside. No giving, no receiving. Since he did not wish to be corrupted by any emotions — his own or others — he was driven in the direction of asceticism. One can readily see that this situation provided a minimal incentive for growth. Because he had become almost suffocated in his grim armor of rectitude, there was almost no appeal that you could make to anything in this man, for none of the things that are meaningful to others had any real meaning for him. But if you compare people like this — who, fortunately, are rarely in the extremity that I have just described — with the type of neurotic individual who has a compulsive need for affection, then you will sense the difference. For no matter how distorted this need for affection may be, it nevertheless proclaims the affirmative, “I do want something! I do want a good relationship with people.” It is precisely this affirmative attitude towards life which makes such an individual accessible to therapy, makes him interested in all the factors in himself that alienate him from desirable relationships with people. For this reason, we could say that even in its neurotic, distorted form, love, or a desire for love, still retains some of its constructive and beneficent powers.")]),a("p",[e._v("What, then, is love — real love? Is it merely a romantic illusion? Does it necessitate living through another in a state of dependency, or sadistically? These questions are frequently raised. Yet, while they are scientifically valid, they are not the reason for our scientific interest.What we sense in them is a note of distress — a protest against what is felt as debunking — an anxious plea, “Is there nothing but neurotic love?” And this question is of the utmost value. But are we debunking love? I do not believe that we are. What we are seeing, and with reasonable conviction, is that neurosis impairs the capacity to give and to receive love. In some cases, this very incapacity creates a compulsive need for love, while in others, it leads to a defensiveness and hostility. Fortunately, however, even a neurotic love, though it may be impaired, is rarely completely submerged, for there always a remains a part of ourselves that is not determined by unconscious or ulterior motives, that is not given to secretive manipulations, that does not, in short, consider other people as means toward an end. To put it positively, there exists within all of us some degree of genuine sympathy — a sincere liking for others, for what they are. There is real enjoyment in being together, in sharing both joy and sorrow. And there is, too, the deep satisfaction in helping in the growth of another, and in the warm, close feeling of growing together. All of this is real love. But if this description does not suffice, I can do no better than quote Paul’s advice in the thirteenth chapter of his first letter to the Corinthians, for I do not think that it has ever been equaled as a definition of love. You will note that I have substituted ‘love’ for the word ‘charity’ wherever it appears in the text quoted below, because, it seems to me that ‘love’ is the more pertinent term for us today.")]),a("p",[e._v("And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. 4 Love suffereth long, and is kind.

Discussing the personal life in his book Reason and Emotion, he finds chastity as the capacity to love whole-heartedly, without ulterior motives. Macmurray distinguishes between personal relationships, entered into for their inherent value to the participants, and relationships which are developed and cultivated for some purpose. The latter he defines as functional relationships. For instance, if you work with others on the auxiliary council, or in a union, or in a scientific group, you don’t come together primarily because you like to see each other. You may enjoy their company, but your main purpose in associating with them is the work to be done. In contrast to this, a personal relationship is one into which we enter for no other purpose than the relationship itself, in which we can express our whole selves in an atmosphere of mutuality and fellowship. It is difficult to find a word to express the unique quality of such a relationship — not because our language is inadequate, but because the more familiar words have been bandied about so much that they have come to mean either too much or too little.")]),a("p",[e._v("Indeed, through constant misuse, they have accumulated such a variety of emotional connotations that they blur our concept of what they precisely denote. Take, for example, the words ‘friendship,’ ‘fellowship,’ ‘communion.’ Each conveys a part of the meaning. But what is common to them all is a relationship between people which has no purpose beyond itself, in which they associate because it is natural for human beings to share their experiences, to understand each other, to find joy and satisfaction in living together, in expressing and revealing themselves to one another. If we ask why people form friendships, or love one another, the question must remain unanswerable. We can simply say that it is the nature of people to do so, for only in this way can they truly fulfill themselves. Essentially, both Paul and Macmurray agree that the very value of love does not lie in something mysterious or ecstatic. Nor, certainly, is it confined to sexual satisfaction. Rather, it is to be characterized by the quality of the relationship between two people and their capacity to give whole-heartedly in this relationship.")]),a("p",[e._v("To be sure, the ‘love’ we speak of is often confused with ‘falling in love.’ No one will deny that it is a wonderful feeling, but let us always remember that it is the easiest part of love, its most charming aspect. It is also the part in which we deceive ourselves most frequently, insofar as we are inclined to mistake for love, for instance, what actually may be a wish to conquer, or simple sexual desire. This confusion is not only fostered by the movies, but glamorized and romanticized. In our celluloid romances, people eventually embrace each other. From there on, we are free to suppose that they live happily ever after. Thus, movies seduce us, willingly enough, from the uncomfortable problems of reality, into every human being’s most delightful pastime, ‘wishful thinking.’ Indeed, they make it all too easy for us to assume what cannot and should not be taken for granted. Even the directors and producers realize that although our ability to love is impaired, we are nevertheless highly susceptible to its more ingratiating gestures. Exploiting this rather commonplace human weakness, they consistently throw the spotlight on the romantic aspects of being in love, pretty much to the exclusion of the paler and more sober realities.")]),a("p",[e._v("Such erroneous attitudes are bound to result in a gross underestimation of the human elements which are really the most important factors in the relationship. As a consequence of such misconceptions, people are wont to talk ever so glibly about friendship. They would refer to a casual travel acquaintance as “my very best friend.” Or they may say, “I have so many — ten, twenty — very best friends.” All of which, of course, is quite impossible. On the other hand, sometimes they casually remark, “Oh, that’s merely a friendship.” Or they may terminate a sexual relationship with a coy proposal, “But we can still be friends.” When speaking of friendship, it is easy to belittle it without realizing that it really is a serious expression of a cultural dilemma. With the many disturbances in our personal relationships, which are the outgrowth of our living in a changing world, and in a competitive civilization, we all have a measure of anxiety, and we all need affection. At the same time, however, we are inhibited in love for the very same reasons. And so we start to pretend, to make-believe, that we have friends, or that friendship may be had for the mere asking. In my opinion, the very essence of love is friendship at its best.")]),a("p",[e._v("What, then, we must ask ourselves, is it that gives love its unique significance? We might reply that it offers so many possibilities of making us happy. But I don’t think that this, while it most certainly is true, answers the question satisfactorily. For surely there are many other things that bring us happiness — for instance, our work. Then, too, not even the greatest love is immune to sorrow and hardships. For all of these reasons, we must be more specific in expressing its unique value. All that I am about to say about this question hinges upon the demonstrable fact that human relationships are the most essential part of our life, and that the quality of these relationships constitutes much of what is specifically human.")]),a("p",[e._v("To begin with, love carries us out of our emotional isolation — loneliness, egocentricity — in short, out of our exclusive concern for ourselves. Sex alone may also do that. Even infatuation may crack the shell that encases and imprisons a personality. But love does much more. It affords the opportunity for sharing — sharing responsibility, sharing joy, sharing good, giving mutual assistance. Then, too, love offers the possibility of feeling at peace and at home, of feeling, “Here, I have roots, something I need.” Our life is so strenuous, so precarious, that this restful sense of being entirely welcome is doubly important to us in that it carries with it the assurance that our welcome derives not from possible fame or fortune, but from what we ourselves really are.")]),a("p",[e._v("This does not mean, of course, that we should abuse the spirit of a relaxing home environment, by using it as a convenient opportunity to blow off steam or to fly off the handle, or even to abandon all the amenities of civilized living, all at the expense of a patient spouse. On the contrary, it is highly important for us to cherish a congenial home environment for its real value to us, providing an atmosphere of good will, of welcome, and of warm appreciation. And finally there is the plain fact — the essential point of this lecture — that love will always be the most effective stimulus to human growth. We cannot grow in a vacuum. How, actually, does a person grow? To begin with, love provides us with powerful incentives to overcome our shortcomings and difficulties. Our human frailties are bound to appear in any close love relationship. You can be an excellent teacher, social worker, businessman, or executive, without revealing many of your personal shortcomings. Your position may provide conditions which enable you to function easily, such as deferential recognition or rewards for ambition. You may even withhold large parts of your personality from such a situation. But, in a close relationship, any disturbance that you have is bound to manifest itself sooner or later. Whether it be hypersensitivity to hurts, an arrogant insistence upon having your own way, abject dependence upon the wishes or approval of others, an overbearing conviction of the infallibility of your judgment, or any other eccentricity of yours, it will reveal itself in a close relationship, and it is certain to cause friction. On the other hand, if you really desire and value a sound companionship, then you will bend every effort to avoid hurting your partner, or ruining the relationship, and as soon as you become aware that you have done either, you will begin to examine yourself to discover what factors in yourself are interfering with the proper growth of that desirable relationship.")]),a("p",[e._v("Whatever changes ensue from this self-analysis enrich not only you but your partner as well. So, too, if your partner changes for the better, in response to your sympathetic encouragement, not only you, nor he, but the partnership as a whole has benefitted. For it must always be understood that it is mutual interest which provides the most powerful incentive for undertaking the painful task of self-examination and change for the better. Furthermore, any moderately good love relationship provides opportunities for mutual help in this respect. And by mutual help, I definitely do not mean that people in love should engage in analyzing each other. So used, analysis may become a very destructive tool, and at best may lead merely to feelings of frustration on the part of both people.")]),a("p",[e._v("As I see it, mutual help is something quite different. I am thinking of the very simple fact that not only do people in love have very strong reactions to each other, but that the closeness of their relationship enables them to discuss their reactions to each other in a friendly spirit of give-and-take. Consider, for example, the situation of the wife who is sexually responsive some nights, but disconcertingly frigid on others. Wondering what the trouble might be, her husband in all probability would make an earnest attempt to discover the difficulty. A frank discussion of the matter might reveal hypersensitiv[ity] on her part, or some aggressiveness on his part, of which he may not even be aware. In any case, such a discussion could help to develop a sound partnership. In this manner, both partners may grow more secure in the feeling that they are accepted, despite their shortcomings, or at least that they are not condemned nor rejected because of them.")]),a("p",[e._v("At this point, you may well ask, “But does not the analytic relationship provide a similar situation?” Yes, it does — because there, too, the patient can freely express himself without fear of being rejected or condemned. Unfortunately, however, not everybody can be analyzed. Moreover, a love relationship contains one factor which the analytic relationship does not have, either to the same degree or to the same extent: namely, the factor of mutuality in assistance. That, in itself, is highly conducive to the development of all the qualities that are so essential to our human growth: tolerance, considerateness, sympathy, a feeling of “we,” rather than the barren and isolated “I.” These are the possible gains. On the other hand, we must be aware of the fact that anything which has such power to help may, if not properly used, become a destructive force. And the destructive aspect, unfortunately, is not so rare that all of us have not observed the evidence of its encroachment upon happiness, leaving little else but disappointment, disenchantment, and bitterness. But whether the one or the other will be the outcome in any given situation depends on both partners, and to a much greater extent than is usually assumed. As with any other good thing, this sort of love does not fall into our laps. It is difficult to obtain and requires effort.")]),a("p",[e._v("How are we to qualify ourselves for it? First, we must have the willingness and capacity for a friendly acceptance of the partner as he really is. By that, I do not mean a blindness to shortcomings. For certainly, idealization of the partner — or what is worse, mutual admiration — may be quite pleasant for a time, for I do not believe that anyone minds being admired, but there is much to be said against it, because we are destined to disappointment. The act of idealization implies putting another person on a pedestal, which is dangerous both for him and for yourself. It also carries with it the wish and the expectation that you, too, be idealized. But it also means that you are too exacting — that rather than considering the ideals of your partner, you insist upon imposing your own upon him and demanding that he live up to them. This is a sin against a fundamental sense of accepting the other person as he is, which implies the full realization that he is a different person, with different needs, and probably one with different wishes from those that you have. Consequently, idealization is not useful in helping us to grow, chiefly because it blurs our critical vision, prevents us from seeing the things that should be changed.")]),a("p",[e._v("On the other hand, I do not mean that having a critical eye is synonymous with fault-finding. So many people pride themselves on being realistic when actually they are merely peering through the cracked mirror of their own discontent. In any case, criticisms that are made in a fault-finding spirit will not be helpful because they have been made without a true perspective of the whole situation. Such people will look only at the shortcomings and will have no appreciation of the whole person. Accepting the partner as he really is would also include not making him responsible for what he is not and hence for what he cannot be responsible [for being].")]),a("p",[e._v("What does such acceptance imply? Does it mean being aware of all the aspects of his personality? Certainly, that is part of what is meant, but the awareness should be of a constructive nature. For one can be aware of the person and of the many facets of his personality, yet harbor a feeling of mere tolerance. That is not being constructive. Thinking constructively means being aware of assets and shortcomings, always with the conviction that these shortcomings are neither fatal nor final. Acceptance has a further meaning which it is difficult for me to describe. When an artist paints a picture, he presents what he considers essential in the landscape, omitting the irrelevant. In the Bible, we learn that man sees what is before his eyes, but God sees the heart. I don’t mean that we should assume that divine faculty, but we might strive a little in that direction.")]),a("p",[e._v("A second qualification for love is the feeling of mutuality, which implies the existence of some basis of equality. There will be plenty of differences, but within the realm of friendship and love, there should be equality in the sense that both partners are equally entitled to respect and considerateness. There should be also an equal share in making efforts. Moreover, mutuality distinctly implies a feeling of we, that this is our life, these are our goals, this is our happiness. Why is this mutuality so difficult for the neurotic person? Principally because, as a result of his basic anxiety, he is unconsciously ruled by the feeling of “I against the world.” He tends to suspect everyone and to expect everyone to be hostile. He would like to exclude his partner from this grim picture, but often cannot do so. Sooner or later, even the partner will belong to those potentially hostile people. Then, too, because the neurotic is so imbued with a sense of his own weakness, he often develops a defensive feeling of superiority and arrogance. Thus, in a relationship that he considers mutual, he nevertheless expects his partner to make all the adjustments. He assumes that criticism is a faculty that only he may exercise, while expecting graciousness and frankness from her. These, it must be understood, are unconscious claims which may take a long time to bring into a patient’s awareness. Finally, a good love relationship requires emotional sincerity — that is, the whole-hearted expression not only of thoughts but of feelings. Here, we might well recall Macmurray’s words, “Chastity is the ability to love wholeheartedly, without ulterior motives.”")]),a("p",[e._v("We are, by and large, much less appreciative of emotional sincerity, than of intellectual integrity. Emotional sincerity implies not only withholding the expression of feelings we do not have, it also assumes the willingness to express those which are immeasurably important to another. Unfortunately, the neurotic often is afraid of having any positive feelings, preferring rather to be sadistic and frustrating. Consequently, he may restrain his emotions, regarding them as a weakness. Although the neurotic is badly equipped for love, he is not excluded from it. For his capacity as a rule is not dead, but impaired. And, despite his many handicaps, love offers even him the greatest possibility for growth. But it is essential that he should want a good relationship.")]),a("p",[e._v("What we see during the course of an analysis is that when one partner improves, the other improves also. This shows that the vicious circle, wherein the more the one clings, the more the other withdraws, can be reversed. This is also possible without analysis — if, instead of being too convinced that the fault is on the other side, or too resigned to the notion that “I just don’t love him,” we honestly search for our own share in each difficulty that arises. But this is difficult and requires much self-discipline.")]),a("p",[e._v("In conclusion, I should like to say a few very simple things. Love is of the utmost value for our growth.

While such tendencies form an interesting aspect of the general problem of sadism, it is not this aspect that we will stress, and this is for two reasons: first of all, perversions are comparatively rare occurrences; and secondly, they are only one among many more important manifestations of the sadistic character. We shall speak, instead, of the sadistic character in totality, and also, in particular, of its tendency to find conscious and unconscious gratification or thrill in criticizing, in degrading, in humiliating, and in enslaving or exploiting the partner. The sadistic person may be driven by a compulsive desire and need to enslave others, especially a love partner. In consequence, his victim will be reduced to the status of a superman’s slave — deprived not only of any independent wishes and feelings, but of making any claims whatsoever upon the superman.")]),a("p",[e._v("Sometimes, this compulsive drive expresses itself in the impulse to mold or educate the victim.

This same general idea might hold true in homosexual relationships involving a younger and an older man. Frequently though not invariably, the sadistic partner in a sexual relationship is haunted by a possessive jealousy, and exercises this jealousy in order to inflict torture. Such involvements are characterized by the fact that keeping a bulldog grip upon the victim is of such vital interest to the sadist than his own life. Consequently, he is inclined to neglect his career, and will even to forgo the pleasures and advantages of meeting other people, rather than permit his partner any degree of independence.")]),a("p",[e._v("Very characteristic of sadistic impulses are the devices employed to enslave a love partner.

Through brow-beating and intimidation, he will succeed in convincing his partner that nobody else would be capable of giving him such understanding, such powerful support, so much sexual satisfaction, so many varied interests, et cetera. In fact, who else would tolerate him? All these tactics achieve the desired goal — effectively isolating the partner from all contacts.

Hedda feels bitter resentment toward life because it has not fulfilled any of her expectations, and her resentment toward life is actively turned back onto life, and onto her environment. She actually has all that should make for happiness: security, a home, and a devoted husband; but for inner reasons, she can enjoy nothing. She is intelligent, very attractive, but she cannot love. Her life is actually empty and useless. Her permanent attitude is one of boredom, and beneath her boredom, we see a profound hopelessness. She is like a person who is tied to a tree at the fringe of a beautiful garden full of fruit, food, and water; she can look into the garden, but starves within the sight of its abundance.

A desperate inner suffering turns a person sour and venomous towards others. The attitude becomes: “If I can get nothing from life, why should you? I’ll make you pay for my unhappiness.”")]),a("p",[e._v("In Hedda’s case, the attempt to extract such payment from the people around her takes several characteristic forms.

Hedda knows whose hat it is, but she picks it up with this remark: “Look there! the servant has left her old bonnet lying about on a chair.”")]),a("p",[e._v("Thirdly, Hedda tries always to enslave others, to have them constantly at her beck and call.

To these unfortunates, they offer help, support, advice, and may actually be helpful, to a certain extent; but the help is usually given for the purpose of gaining a thrill in the power to rescue, to educate, or to mold another human being.

All he wants is to make a career. Though he does step over people, it does not bother him, it does not even interest him, nor does it thrill him. The only thing that can excite him is to go a step ahead in his career.

But sadistic people are fascinated by their power to hurt, exploit, enslave, and to humiliate. Their attitude is quite different from reactive hostility. André Maurois describes their uncanny intuition for discovering exactly where others are the most vulnerable.

For most of them, there is also another side—a side which wants to be decent and fair—opposed to the desire for revenge. It is somewhat like the problem of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

What sustains the sadist’s attitude and makes it poignant is his further development, the distant end result of the early humiliations, the stifling and shriveling of his emotional life, the inner despair over himself. In spite of any surface bravado, he has given himself up as a bad and a hopeless job. He does not expect, and in many cases, defiantly, does not even want, what life has to offer.")]),a("p",[e._v("From this basis of bitter envy, resentment, and despair, he has come to want only two things: these are, first, to get even, and secondly, the enjoyment of vindictive triumphs.

And, as he has lost his pride and self-respect, he will constantly attempt to humiliate other people’s dignity as human beings, and degrade them into mere creatures whom he dominates and exploits. In spite of an aura of righteousness, he feels guilty; and therefore he must make others feel guilty constantly. His desire for vindictive triumph shows itself in a determination to gain a victory over all who have frustrated him, and also in a restless drive to excel. In some respects, the fairy tale of “Cinderella”—her early humiliations at the hands of her step-sisters, and her final triumph over them, illustrates this aspect of sadistic trends — the need to excel over others.")]),a("p",[e._v("However, the sadist’s desire for revenge is not merely expressions of his bitterness and resentment.

For the most part, he is unconscious of the significance of his daily behavior towards others.

The aggressive type, on the other hand, although expressing sadistic tendencies quite openly, is not necessarily more aware of them.

I think that that is not always so. It is my experience that there is generally also something the matter with the person who becomes helplessly involved with a sadist.

He conceives of man as a helpless, fore-doomed, and wretched being, driven by powerful instincts which he cannot control. The most that man can hope for, according to Freud, is a socially acceptable adjustment to a situation which is necessarily bad, without it crippling him too much in the process. A further proof of the influence of the culture in which Freud lived was evidenced by his attitude towards women. Reflecting the Victorian thesis that men were generally superior to women, his psychology was predominantly male. He regarded women as something less than men — individuals who were incomplete men, inherently inferior to men, and hence utterly incapable of scaling the physical and spiritual heights of the male domain.

They were beginning to live on a somewhat more equal plane with men, although even now their emancipation is still far from complete. Sufficient psychoanalytic, clinical data has been recorded to convince us that there is neither a “masculine” nor a “feminine” psychology, but that the individual — regardless of the difference in sex — is our primary interest and concern. In contrast to Freud’s generally pessimistic view — that mankind is the fore-doomed victim of destructive drives which he cannot control — our present, basic ideas are positive, optimistic, and essentially hopeful. Modern psychoanalysis operates on the conviction that the human being can reason, act, and feel; that he knows what he wants, and can do something about realizing his goals. We believe, further, that the individual has the capacity to grow, develop, and be creative; that he wants to, and can enjoy work and love relationships; that he is basically constructive, and that his destructive drives are only secondary results of his fears, activated by the restriction and frustration of his natural, spontaneous creativeness.")]),a("p",[e._v("Against this background, we can now proceed to investigate some aspects of the role of sex in human affairs.

It is something of an anomaly in our society that the natural curiosity of children is applauded in all directions, except with regard to biological facts. A child is aware of its body before it has any real appreciation of self. It is normal and natural for it, therefore, to explore all the bodily orifices, and to stimulate any part of its body for pleasure. Yet, the attitude of the majority of parents is such that the child’s natural curiosity becomes inhibited and frustrated.

Today, an increasingly larger number of women limit their activities less during the menses than they ever did before. A widespread prejudice against sexual activity during menstruation still exists, with the concomitant belief that it is unhygienic — though this is definitely untrue. Participation in sexuality during menses is a concern of the persons involved, and is a matter of their own individual preferences. The duration and frequency of sexual activity are not only matters of individual preference — they are also strongly affected by cultural attitudes. In some cultures, for example, sexual activity is encouraged in the young, whereas in our own, as we have seen, even self-exploratory activity in children is frowned upon.

We would then have what we consider pathological deviations in the sex act. The frequency of sexual activity — whether marital, pre-marital, or extra-marital, is a question of the desires of the two persons concerned in a mutually cooperative activity for the purpose of pleasure.

But how, then, explain that the qualities “masculine” and “feminine” also have fallacious connotations in our culture? “Womanly,” for example, or “feminine,” are synonymous with softness and warmth, while “manly” and “masculine” denote strength and virility. These categorical attributes are merely projections, however, of our cultural attitudes. They are not biological characteristics of men or women. They are, rather, accepted and culturally predetermined characteristics of what we believe to be the difference between the sexes. Actually, the qualities of warmth and strength are innate in all human beings.")]),a("p",[e._v("In an attempt to sustain the contention that women are basically different from men, or vice-versa. The point is frequently made that, after all, only women can bear children. But, for that matter, only men can impregnate women.

But those who argue that point frequently fail to mention the fact that one man can be the father to many children — by one woman, or many women.")]),a("p",[e._v("This is merely my way of illustrating that the use of an anatomical argument to prove a psychological point is both an evidence of unclear thinking and an attempt to avoid the real issue. What we are interested in is not the sexual, anatomical differences per se, but the psychological attitudes toward those sexual, anatomical differences — as determined by our particular cultural pattern. Men who are emotionally insecure often attempt to obtain a feeling of security by assuming a dominating position toward women. In the last few years, social changes have been so rapid that these men feel threatened by the increasing emancipation and freedom which women have obtained. Such men feel that the way things are going, the time is not far off when women will become uncontrollable and completely out of hand. Yet, at the same time, these men — who assume the role of the benevolent, stronger male, caring for the helpless and weaker-minded female — complain bitterly, but secretly enjoy the fact that women are “different,” and not endowed with a sense of justice, camaraderie, stability, and clear-headedness — which they feel are peculiar to men. The point that this type of man overlooks is that a woman functioning as a person in a real, cooperative interpersonal relationship would not be such a problem to him, and would not have to exact, or have thrust upon her, the alleged special privileges, prerogatives, and deferences shown to her in our culture. Although it may appear that men are mainly responsible for this situation, actually, women, unconsciously — and often consciously — nurture and invite just those atittudes. They feel that they are gaining by these special privileges — but at the same time, contradictorily, want to be treated just like men. Clearly, they would be better off without these special prerogatives, or being treated “just like men,” and if they devoted their energies to becoming their own selves.")]),a("p",[e._v("Our social attitudes toward sex have also created an extensive, vulgar male vocabulary in which sexual activity is referred to violent and humiliating terms. This is a direct reflection of our deeply-ingrained conception of sex as a violent and humiliating assault on a woman by a man in which she is harmed, and is the unwilling partner. As a result, many men and women have to re-create this neurotic setting before they can obtain “sexual satisfaction.” Usually, however, women do not express themselves sexually in vulgar terms. In accordance with the rules of the game — of the romantic game — all references to the sexual act must be indirect. A man may be referred to as having a “nice physique” and being “clean-limbed.” But any direct reference to the male genital region is strictly taboo. Sex can be used for the same neurotic purpose by both men and women. And what holds true for sex holds for any thought, feeling, or act which is shared by two individuals. What concerns us, primarily, is the meaning — that thought, feeling, or act — may have for the individual in relationship to himself, and to those with whom he lives.

Many women use sex as a lure, to ensnare their men, as well as to obtain gifts and admiration as an object of sexual desire.

Modern psychoanalytic research has revealed that a basic cause of the difficulty these organically sound men have often lies in their hostile attitude towards women. They do not want to give women any sexual satisfaction, and ejaculate prematurely out of unconscious spite. It is a form of protection — a means of preventing them from coming close to a woman for fear that she might sense their hostility and retaliate in kind. In a broader sense, premature ejaculation may also be a symptom of a generaly anti-social attitude. Some men are afraid of any close human contact, because it might prove a threat to their false notions of independence and misogynistic self-sufficiency. Frigidity in women may also have a similar connotation, or it may be that they must deny having any pleasure. Admission of such pleasure might mean, to them, the existence of an obligation which they cannot or do not want to repay.")]),a("p",[e._v("The excessive emphasis on sex in our culture is manifested in our dream-language, and has been subjected to a mistaken and one-sided interpretation from the Freudian viewpoint. Many dreams which seem to be purely sexual in nature are actually only superficially concerned with sex.

He has a long penis which reaches from himself to a woman who stands some distance off. At first glance, this dream seems to be concerned with the problem of potency. The patient’s history reveals that it has quite a different meaning. Factually, he has no sexual problem. All his life, this man insisted on lying back while women were at his beck and call, assuming all responsibility, and were the active partners in the relationship. In other words, women were relegated to a safe distance, near enough to be enjoyed, in carefree comfort, but sufficiently far away to make it impossible for them to affect him personally or to encroach on his privacy.

She played one against the other for what she could get out of them, and so prevented either from coming too close to her and making demands. The disturbance in her sexual relationship, as expressed in her dream, was merely a manifestation of her disturbed interpersonal relationships in general. Actually, this woman was not only frigid, but felt nauseated at the idea of a man kissing her.

It is of a man or a woman who dreams that he or she is having sexual intercourse or defecating in some extremely public place. This dream usually reveals an attitude of unconscious arrogance, and has little in it of sexual significance. It manifests the dreamer’s defiance toward what people think of him, to such an extent that he does not care who sees his sexual activity, defecation, or urination. The sexual content of the dream is, hence, far less important than the general attitude of contemptuous indifference to society and its conventions. It is fairly common for a woman psychoanalytic patient to “fall in love” with her analyst. She may overtly or covertly suggest a relationship, and she may even believe that her desires are quite sincere and legitimate. Yet, on examination, we commonly find that the proposed liaison has ulterior motives. The patient either feels that she could dominate the situation, if she could make the analyst respond to her advances, or else it might be a means of breaking off the analytic relationship, or a desire to compromise the analyst professionally. If this could be accomplished, everything unpleasant or unacceptable which the analyst had said could, she feels, be invalidated on the grounds of a lack of professional dignity or ability. Again, such a patient might be using sex to get so close to the analyst that he would not be able to see her clearly.

Among these are what are popularly known as our “instincts” — many of which scientific observation has already proved to be merely the results of conditioned behavior.

For example, a very effeminate man may lose his so-called feminine traits. The significance attributed to masculinity and femininity can be appreciated only in terms of the life history of the individual and against the background of the culture in which he lives. For the individual, at birth, contains within himself a precipitate of his heredity and his culture. The geographical, social, economical, and political components of his culture will not only operate upon him after birth through his parents, and later through his increasing with life about him, but they have been acting upon him before birth — more directly, through his mother. At birth, a particular individual has a penis or a vagina. Immediately, cultural influences begin to operate. The child is referred to as a “boy” or a “girl,” and is called “Peter,” or “Ruth” — names that have quite different connotations. Thus, before the child even knows who he is and that he has a sex, the whole matter seems, quite literally, to have been taken out of his hands. He is obliged to content with the personal biases and idiosyncrasies of his parents, brothers and sisters, relatives, a family history, its social and economic status, the locality in which he lives, the type of government then existing, and the historical approach during which he made his appearance. Before proceeding, it is essential that we come to a mutual understanding regarding certain terms. By “genital,” I mean the actual genitalia — the penis and the vagina. By “sexual,” I mean something broader. The term includes any thought, action, or feeling in which the genital apparatus is a part, whether alone or with another person; and, any other thought, action, or feeling involving the secondary, non-genital, sexual anatomical characteristics.

Our problem, then, is how to examine individuals, male and female, and how to determine what effect their special anatomical differences may have. These interacting, interrelating, and integrating forces can be understood only in terms of interpersonal relationships. Thus, the attitudes that an individual develops for purposes of security, safety, health, and as part of his neurosis, we refer to as his “total character structure.” Our specific interest is in real and apparent masculinity and femininity. The more we clarify and dissipate what is merely apparent, the closer we shall come to knowing what is real. Consequently, we should ascertain how, and at what points cultural influences act upon the individual, and to which he or she reacts in the development of the so-called “masculine” and “feminine” attitudes.

In fact, these connotative values have been pushed to such extremes that woman is regarded by some not only as the sacred fountainhead and dispenser of all feelings, but is invested with that rare capacity called “feminine intuition.” This lead to such ridiculous clichés as “Mother knows best” and “Who should know more about my child than I, his mother?”")]),a("p",[e._v("We may as well admit, at the outset, and at this point, that it is still another question as to who really does know.

Love is theirs to give and to receive, to withhold and to refuse. This view, of course, is double-edged, because, as a result of it, women become not only the greatest source of love, but also the deepest source of pain, through their refusal to love, or to be loved.

Through various appropriate and not-so-appropriate gestures, she indicates approval or disapproval regarding soiling and wetting. Her negative reactions result in the development of prudishness and the abhorrence of any mention of physiological functions.

However, on careful scrutiny, we can see much more that lies beneath the surface. The mother was exaggeratedly feminine in some ways, yet almost masculine in others. Indeed, she gave the impression of being a loving mother and a real woman in civic interests. Her façade was that of a gracious and idealistic person. But behind the façade were secretiveness, evasiveness, and sadism. Considering this a man’s world, where women were invariably downtrodden, she was a vigorous feminist, and considered herself a very spiritual person. She exploited a compliant manner merely to lead one on and sabotage one’s best efforts.

She was considered a perfect child by her mother, and was heartily approved of by her two maiden aunts, and had won a somewhat reserved affection from her father and brother.

In addition to having a knack for saying pert and clever things, she employed evasiveness and cunning tricks to win her mother’s support against her brother, who was considered a “bad” boy. Indeed, it always happened that when she was innocently attending to her affairs, the bad boy would start to hit her. She would come, screaming, to her mother and aunts, who would placate her, and punish her brother. And, to make matters worse for him, little sister would then approach him in a spirit of generous forgiveness. In the course of her mother’s psychoanalysis, significant changes took place in the girl. Her mother realized that unwittingly, she had encouraged her daughter in the role that she herself had assumed. Once the mother had seen through her own sweetness and light attitudes as well as her dishonesties, she became aware of how she had encouraged the very same attitudes in her little girl. As the mother became more direct, honest, and healthily assertive, she began to deplore many of the qualities in her child, which heretofore had appeared so charmingly feminine. Consequently, in the course of two years, the girl herself developed into a more direct, open, and forthright person. Having seen through her own techniques of needling her husband until he flew into a rage, she began to see how her daughter had used identical tactics with her brother until he reached the state of helpless fury. Once the little girl sensed that this role was no longer valuable, she gave it up, and began to regard her mother as the dominant female personage in the household. The following conversation took place between daughter and mother some two years after the mother’s analysis had begun. The heretofore sweet and charming child had begun exhibiting her latent temper, which apparently was being stimulated, now, by the need to fight for what she wanted. Moreover, she had learned that having a temper was permissible. In fact, by this time, the entire family were expressing themselves more freely, except the maiden aunts, whose importance in the household had diminished considerably, and were having a bewildering time of it, as these apparently cataclysmic changes were taking place. Janie, the little girl, had become angry at her mother, and looking up at her with a winning smile on her face, said, “I could gouge your eyes out, pull out all your hair, and kick you in the stomach!” The following day, she had a slight cold and was kept in bed. One of her maiden aunts came in to play with her. After about an hour, Janie said to her aunt, “I’m tired. I want you to go” — to which the aunt replied, “I just want to finish threading this needle.” Janie insisted petulantly, “But I’m tired of you. I want to be alone!” And, when the shocked aunt retorted, “How will you feel, Janie, if I tell your mother?” — the little girl replied briskly, “I’ll tell her myself!”")]),a("p",[e._v("What changes took place in the little boy?

In pursuing his exaggerated masculine role, the father had unwittingly supported his wife’s seductive manipulations with the boy. When his mother’s psychoanalysis began, the picture I got of the little boy was that of a weak, scrawny boy who was given to petulant outbursts. Extremely tense and sensitive, shy, and withdrawn, he preferred playing with his younger sister, or girls of his own age, refusing to have anything to do with boys. He constantly clung to his mother, and found all kinds of pretexts for touching her, exploring her body, asking intimate questions about sexual differences and about babies. He cried very easily, dawdled in his play and his eating, and suffered from disturbed sleep. The two years of his mother’s analysis wrought a change in this little boy.

Two years later, both children looked like upstanding, direct little people, with more firmness and conviction in their faces — although the little girl still appeared to be mentally the healthier of the two. The following overt changes had taken place in the boy: he now preferred playing with boys, and the more rough-and-tumble, the more he sought them. He took many beatings from these boys, but kept coming back for more. He talked more, and had assumed the gruff, “Hail, fellow-met-well” language of boys. Much less fearful of his father, he would openly and aggressively attack him, in words and while tussling. Although his newly-begotten assertiveness was quite aggressive, violent, and often misdirected, he was feeling his oats. On occasion, he even differed quite openly with his mother — which previously he would not have dared to do. Moreover, he had learned to cope with his little sister, and with girls in general.")]),a("p",[e._v("In terms of the roles dictated by our culture, we might sum up this family reorientation by saying that the father had become less exaggeratedly masculine, and the mother less exaggeratedly feminine, in addition to having given up many of her so-called masculine drives. The boy had become less effeminate, and his sister, much less the exaggerated little girl. Altogether, the entire family had developed into happier, more human, direct, and honest people. When an individual begins psychoanalysis, he may not even be aware of what role — with reference to masculinity or femininity — he has adopted. Indeed, it usually takes some time before he realizes that he has adopted a role — generally, the exaggeratedly masculine or feminine individual — may feel that he is being spontaneously and naturally masculine or feminine. This would be especially true in those extreme instances where the individual has been completely submerged in the part he is playing. Such people come for psychoanalysis because of the failure of this role to give them a feeling of inner harmony or satisfaction. Nevertheless, their complaints rarely touch upon the real problem: namely, their exaggerated maleness or femaleness. This is equally true in the case of homosexuals. Convinced that they have completely accepted this role, they enter analysis with problems that have no apparent connection with their homosexuality.

Many people get along, and even more live quite satisfactory lives in any of these roles — for it is not the role itself that is important for us, but how it came into being; how it was necessitated by life’s experiences; and what penalties and privations it exacts from us. Consequently, where life has severely, and at an early age, profoundly hurt the individual, a life of constant turmoil and pain is almost inevitable. Some patients come to analysis with the complain that “this married existence, neuter arrangement, or homosexual relationship is not satisfactory to me.” What happens in all analyses, from whatever phase of pseudo-sexuality one may start, is that the patient becomes aware that none of these solutions was or can be satisfactory. He begins to see the necessity for a clear understanding of his neurotic character structure and how it has been maintaining its pseudo-sexual attitude.

Many factors have contributed to this decreasing trend. Some of the general ones are economic and social changes, alterations in family habit patterns, world chaos, and the extension and increased acceptance of birth control information.

Onlies had been considered to be characterized by their selfishness, hypersensitivity, self-centeredness, lack of initiative and self-reliance, and social awkwardness. Theorists have attributed these maladjustments to attitudes they consider are displayed specifically by parents of only children, such as excessive solicitude, overprotectiveness, and tendencies to be too restricting.

It has been gathered from my analytic practice and includes composite data on onlies, adults who were only children, and children and adults who occupied various birth positions in the family. This material is being considered in light of the theory of personality development elaborated by Horney. I might well begin with a brief introduction to the basic concepts involved: First, the basic assumption rests on our belief that every child who is born without physical or mental handicaps has potentialities for healthy personality development. Since personality acquires structure in a human environment, and in response to this environment, the psychological help of the adults in it exerts a decisive influence on the direction of the child’s personality development.")]),a("p",[e._v("Each child has its own unique personality requirements of growth and development, and its own capacities in striving. Also, in each human being there appears to be a deep basic need to establish satisfactory relations with people. This need expresses itself in three ways of moving in relation to people: toward people, in friendliness and for help; against people, to ward off harm, or domination, or in competition; and away from people, to pursue one’s goals, and for solitude. In an environment favorable to normal personality development, the adults are spontaneous and natural in their relation with people as a whole. Therefore, they can accept the child as he is: a factually immature human being, and appreciate his needs to develop, slowly and naturally. Not driven by conscious and unconscious, unfulfilled personality needs, such adults are not disturbed by the child’s uneven tempo of learning and the child’s attempts to develop his capacities for reasoning and judgment. They are not compelled to interfere, and can differentiate between conscious desires to be good, kind, and helpful to the child, and what is real assistance, guidance, and support for the child.")]),a("p",[e._v("The results, for the child, are that he acquires a solid inner feeling about his own importance as a human being, and a balanced picture of his assets and liabilities. He can also develop initiative and self-reliance, and the ability to become responsible for his decisions. Since the child is then equipped with the guideline for differentiation between friend and foe — between what is in his true self-interest and what is opposed to it, the child’s personality development is more likely to be healthy, and has a better chance for survival in the face of later, adverse influences. Since early childhood is the crucial period, for determining the direction of personality development, let us see what occurs adverse conditions, generally.")]),a("p",[e._v("First of all, in such a setup, the adults have personality difficulties or disturbances which interfere with establishing good relations with other people. For example, they may be driven by excessive ambition, or intense needs for affection or detachment, or influenced by their idealization of what a good parent should be. Unconsciously, such parents use the child to satisfy these needs — or at least some of them — and the child’s needs are actually disregarded. It is important to bear in mind that adults who have conscious or unconscious, unfulfilled, compulsive needs, although basically well-intentioned, cannot avoid having an impact about those around them, and unwittingly use their human relationships — whether with a child or with other adults — in the service of these compelling drives. Consequently, the child is not accepted as he is, and his capacities for normal development are stifled. For example, the child may not be accepted for himself, but becomes, unconsciously, a tool for the reflected glory he sheds on his parents, the vicarious neurotic satisfaction they may attain from his beauty, brilliance, health, or good manners. In other respects, his development and his needs may be taken for granted or partially neglected. In the unfavorable family milieu, where parents are disturbed in their human relations, the child must of necessity sacrifice and neglect his own strivings for growth and development to the end of finding ways to relieve his anxiety in relation to his parents. This is the origin of neurosis in childhood.")]),a("p",[e._v("All movements, then, of the child in his human relations, become invested with compulsiveness and indiscriminateness. Under some circumstances, one form of movement predominates, and the others are repressed, but also operate, and determine feelings, and patterns of behavior and traits. If, for example the predominant movement of the child to relieve his anxiety is towards people, most of his energies are diverted in this direction, to win them over, at the expense of total personality development. Now, in the service of these movements, special needs are developed as well as special qualities. So you see, now, that the personality traits which are most in evidence in children — whether they are only-children or non-onlies — are merely representative of the predominant character trend; that is, the predominant way to cope with life and with people. Since both onlies and non-onlies are likely to be exposed to early adverse influences, we would not expect to find any one set of personality traits more characteristic of onliness than another set of traits. Wherever one form of movement predominates, we find corresponding traits. The selfishness and hypersensitivity which theorists consider characteristic of onliness are, in reality, characteristic of distorted personality development or neurotic difficulties. So they are [a] neurotic phenomenon common to all neurotic individuals. These traits are also, therefore, common to only-children. For instance, lack of self-reliance or excessive aggressiveness, or shyness and withdrawal, can be seen in the population as a whole. I have not noted that only-children display one form of movement in relation to people any more than another. The understanding of personality is considerably deepened by viewing separate aspects in the sphere of reference of the total personality structure. In the same way, we get a broader view of the factors influencing personality development if we keep in mind the totality of factors. I believe that, as in the case of personality traits, so you shall see, in what follows, that onliness in and of itself is just one factor, and a secondary one, in comparison to the effect of the adult’s personality strivings which influence the personality development of the child.")]),a("p",[e._v("Before focusing on the nature of the later adjustments made by the singleton, we shall retrace our steps to the period where the normal direction of the child’s personality development has been blocked by environmental pressures. This is the origin of the development of the neurotic personality. The neurotic structure elaborated has a force of its own, in opposition to the healthy strivings in the personality, toward self-fulfillment. The operation of the neurotic forces further impairs the individual’s functioning. This becomes more evident in one area or another — disturbed human relations may result, or lack of productivity in work, or psychosexual disturbances.")]),a("p",[e._v("With this understanding, let us proceed to look at the profiles of some only-children, with a view to investigating some of the sources of their maladjustments. I shall stress the family tone, and the feeling-tone between parent and child, both of which, I feel, far outweigh the factor of onliness in affecting personality development. Eve came into analysis at age of thirty because of dissatisfaction with her career adjustment and unsatisfactory relations with men. She was an only child. Her mother was a gentle, loving, and dependent person, with strong tendencies to subtle domination under the guise of self-sacrifice and felicitude. The mother focused endless attention on the physical welfare of the husband and child. Although she idolized her husband, and effaced herself for him, she was openly rejected by him. He was humiliating and belittling through his continual sarcasm and criticism. Eve’s mother then began to use Eve as her sole reason for living and main source of affection. To gain this affection, although unconsciously motivated, she assented to Eve’s every wish, catered to her and never found fault with her. Eve’s father, on the other hand, focused on Eve’s scholastic work, in which he expected top-notch performance. He gave her some human direction, in the form of pat, moralistic formulae; he preached respect and consideration for others and tolerance. The family tone, as you see, was sadly lacking in these qualities. Eve unconsciously registered these contradictions, as well as the parents’ lack of genuine interest in her real right to self-development. Her mother’s self-sacrificing trends were really domination, and her excessive attention to Eve was interference. Secretly fearing her father, Eve tried to woo him by her successes in school, developing intensive needs for approval which deprived her of real pleasure in studies, made her extremely competitive, and impaired her later success in school. Her neurotic need to succeed interfered with satisfactory relations with people, even though outwardly, she was compliant and submissive. Eve was entirely unaware of her hostile aggressive trends and dependency drives. After college, she became self-supporting and self-reliant, but felt unfulfilled.")]),a("p",[e._v("In her attempt to find a solution to her emotional problems through love, she married a weak, dependent man whom she dominated and secretly despised. The marriage ended in divorce. Subsequent relations with men were also unsatisfactory. She admired and feared strong men, who increased her feelings of inferiority. Until analysis, she was neurotically attached to her father, although he rejected her. This trend was analyzed. It was then found to be not on an instinctual basis, but found to stem from anxiety and guilt-feelings in having failed her father in his ambitious goals for her. This basis for Eve’s attachment to her father seems to be a sounder explanation than attributing it to an Oedipus-complex. Analysis helped Eve to see that she was worthwhile in herself, reduced her approval-needs, freed her for more productive work commensurate with her capacities, and improved her human relations.")]),a("p",[e._v("I am well aware that there were additional influencing factors. Those I have highlighted appeared to me of major importance. The mother’s subtle domination and self-sacrifice crushed Eve’s capacity for sharing, produced an inner feeling of not belonging, and also contributed to an exaggerated notion of her own importance. Her father’s subtle disparagement and overemphasis upon scholastic achievement, with frequent reference to the success of others, contributed to just as false a picture of inferiority. These factors played a large part in her impaired human relations, her intensive need for approval, and her lowered accomplishment in school. Her total personality development suffered under these influences more than from just the fact that she was an only-child. We might speculate that another child in this family milieu of friction and disrespect for human rights would also have been adversely influenced, even with the best consciously-avowed intentions on the part of the adults.")]),a("p",[e._v("Eve was overtly self-reliant, as we’ve seen. Now, Nan — another only-child — was openly helpless, clinging, awkward, and dependent. She was predominantly detached, with strongly repressed aggressive drives.

Her father as a very kindly, non-interfering person, who had married mainly to have a home and good housekeeper. However, he provided for his family, and there his participation in the family group ended. He gave Nan practically no personal support or guidance. Nan’s mother subtly contributed to undermining the child’s self-confidence by being too helpful. She was unconsciously driven by her won impatience, and rarely allowed the child to complete a task at her own tempo. This was one of the major factors in crushing Nan’s incentive to persist in the face of obstacles. At the same time, Nan’s mother expressed disappointment that Nan was no great help in the house. The mother set great emphasis, as you see, upon a girl’s need to be a good housewife for future marriage. Nan’s lack of initiative and self-reliance, together with a horror of the consequences of making a mistake, contributed to mediocre work in school. Her actual accomplishments were below her capacities. She had deep inner feelings of stupidity, worthlessness, and having no right to live.

In her choice of friends, she chose weak women and men, thus unconsciously satisfying her needs for superiority.

Before analysis, she had begun a search for a man who would literally put her in his vest pocket and thus provide protection for life. She had no realization of how she was blocking her own power to gaining satisfaction from living. When the need for helplessness was analyzed, strongly repressed ambitious strivings came into focus. Nan’s mother, also, would not have treated another child much differently. Her values, goals, attitudes, and patterns of behavior would not have been altered by another child.

For purposes of comparison, let us briefly consider Robert, who is the youngest of three. Both parents were overambitious, over-devoted to their children, self-sacrificing, and over-valued intellectual achievements. Robert was very bright and physically somewhat frail. On both scores, he received excessive attention — the rest of his personality development being taken for granted. Exposed to constant emphasis upon his brilliance, and repeatedly-expressed high expectations of extraordinary achievement, Robert developed an excessive need for success and admiration. Inwardly, he felt weak, since he had been unable, because of their outer and his inner pressures, to develop the stamina to persist in the face of obstacles. His success in school was far below his actual capacities. As he progressed, his accomplishments steadily decreased. He was entirely unaware of his fantastic demands upon himself and other people. His horror of producing work with any flaw contributed, in part, to his actual failure in fulfilling his potentials. He became progressively more unable to act on his own behalf, more hopeless, helpless, and dependent. Even when he did accomplish something, he was unable to get any satisfaction from this accomplishment because of his enormously high standards. This, in part, contributed to his feeling of being an utter failure. Again, he was unaware of his strong exploitive tendencies and his dependency drives. His energies were directed towards gaining approval and admiration, particularly from his parents, who condoned every deficiency. Similar attitudes were displayed toward the other children, but not to the same degree. Robert’s relationships with people were unsatisfactory. He was driven to select those who feed him admiration and permit exploitation. Secretly, he despised these weak people on whom he leaned, and to whom he gave little of himself.

He could allow himself to write, to work toward his goals, without a driving need for success, and a paralyzing fear of failure. Yes, Robert’s parents were very self-sacrificing, and they indirectly sacrificed Robert’s total personality development by focusing on one facet of the personality, and unconsciously neglecting the other needs of the growing individual.")]),a("p",[e._v("A survey of other material on only-children and non-onlies reveals a common thread in the family milieu and the parental attitude. In all instances, the adults were disturbed in their human relations, and the family tone was lacking in a spirit of mutuality and sharing. There was an absence of reliable warmth and friendliness, overemphasis upon one aspect of personality development, with disregard of other assets, and an unconscious disregard for the rights of human beings — whether children or adults — to be themselves and to choose their way of life. The parents were basically well-intentioned. Unaware of their own compulsive drives, they interfered with the child’s development either by impatience, excessive urging to live up to their expectations, inconsistent appreciation, being too helpful, too devoted, too self-sacrificing, too perfectionistic, or setting no goals for the child. Such attitudes and behavior result in the child’s feeling worthless, lacking in capacities, and rejected as he is. Natural incentive and initiative for growth and development, natural curiosity and courage, are crushed and buried under such influences.")]),a("p",[e._v("When one aspect of the child’s personality, or one goal, is stressed to the exclusion of others, as, for example, beauty, popularity, or scholastic achievement, the child feels he is no good as he is, and develops no feeling of significance as a total person, since he must devote his energies to gaining acceptance and approval in the particular area emphasized by the adults. Now, as to the feeling of not belonging, this is not particularly characteristic of the only-child. Self-sacrificing, interfering parents frustrate a child, prevent its participation in the activities of the family group, and inhibit the child from experiencing its own resources. They also prevent the participation of the child in his own activities. This feeling of isolation in later life is a further outgrowth of a total neurotic structure. Self-sacrificing parents also contribute to the child’s forming a dual picture of itself, as unusual, and also as inadequate. As one only-youngster said, “If they thought I could do it, they would not come along and help me so much when I’m trying to get it myself. I guess I should have done it. I guess I just can’t. Oh, I’m afraid to try.” Another adult, who was the sixth of nine children, recalled, “They always suggested what I should do, and said the others could do it. They asked me, why couldn’t I? It made me feel so stupid and worthless. So I gave up — it was no use.”")]),a("p",[e._v("On the other hand, unrealistic reassurance has its detrimental effects also on the child development of persistence and stamina.

When, later, he actually attempted a task, and found initial learning difficulties, he quickly became discouraged and disillusioned. He had believed wanting was enough for doing. How often parents fail to recognize that the child’s interpretations do not coincide with the meaning they intended — and then they become vexed with the child. I feel that I cannot express sufficiently the importance of the child’s reaction to the feeling behind the spoken word — whether hostility over optimism, or pessimism, disbelief, or lack of appreciation.

Using such a theory as a basis for psychoanalytic therapy, we dispense first with a static concept of maturity as a finite goal attained at a specific period in a person’s lifetime. Maturity now assumes the position of an absolute goal, toward which an individual continually strives, in the course of maturing and self-development. This concept implies human capacities for continuous change and development, from birth to death. In the process of such development, a human being becomes increasingly conscious of his own inner resources, and steadily proceeds to strengthen and integrate them to the end of becoming a more really independent individual.")]),a("p",[e._v("At this point, the question may arise: Don’t we all, in the natural course of events, develop ourselves as we grow older?

Before considering some of this evidence, we shall describe the characteristics of a person who has been maturing in a healthy way. First, such a person has achieved a solid basis of inner unity. He is not thrown into a panic when he asks himself the question, “Who am I?” He is sure of his own identity. The opposite occurred in a boy of twenty-three, who had lost an awareness of his identity as a result of severe inner conflicts. This bewilderment about himself became apparent to him while reading the satire, “The Bear Who Wasn’t There.” This boy actually became terror-stricken.

To being with, he experiences his own inner aliveness of feeling and is aware that these feelings arise from within himself.

He can admit, with inner conviction, “I feel affectionate; I am hostile; I am tired; I am dissatisfied; or I am pleased.” A young woman who was beginning to find her own center of gravity within herself, after a long period of dependency on others, described her first experience of spontaneous emotion for her fiancé in this way: I became aware of a warm feeling of affection arising from the pit of my stomach.

He can formulate and express them, and assume responsibility for them. He can say to himself, or to others, “I think this, I mean this, and these thoughts are mine, whether or not others think in a similar manner or different manner.” He uses his capacities for reason, judgment, and discrimination to evaluate the facts in a situation or the facts about a person. He draws his conclusion from the facts as they are, and does not distort them for his own satisfaction or for the satisfaction of others. He accepts responsibility for the consequences of his conclusions. He is able to accept criticism and uses it to change or improve his ideas. He also can evaluate the criticism offered to him. He knows his own value, he is aware of his beliefs, and accepts ownership for them. A healthy, mature person has also achieved a basic self-confidence as a result of being connected with his own feelings and thoughts. The basic confidence permits him to feel, think and act as a unit, and to be conscious of this unity.")]),a("p",[e._v("Since he is aware of his resources, and has been developing them, he can afford to test their limits and take the risk of making a mistake or even failing in a pursuit. He is capable of visualizing goals of his own choosing, which are commensurate with a true evaluation of his own resources. Since he does not impose unreasonable demands on himself in this matter, he can actively strive for the goal. He responds to successes and failures with a certain equanimity, and realizes his share in one or the other. He acknowledges openly, “I did this, I did it this way, these were my objectives, these are my mistakes.” In the event of failure, he has suffictient tolerance and respect for himself to learn from his mistakes and make renewed efforts toward his goals. He has an inner strength which he uses to separate the factors in a situation that can be attributed to the actual limitations inherent in it from the factors within himself which might be contributing to such limiations. For example, he does not expect himself to work well when he is fatigued, nor to overcome the limitations set by time, space, and difficulties with co-workers. He can work fairly comfortably within these limitations.")]),a("p",[e._v("A healthy person has a true evaluation of his resources, and his center of gravity lies within himself. Such an inner organization contributes immeasurably to satisfactory human relations. Since such an individual is on friendly terms with himself, he feels basically friendly toward people. He can show his friendliness and receive the friendship of others. He feels welcomed, and welcomes others, particularly since he decides when he wants to be with people and with whom he likes to be. He is also able to be with himself, and pursue his own interests. When the situation warrants, he can reject friendship and tolerate rejection by others. He can agree, disagree, and express antagonism or hostility if he sees fit. He can ask for, receive, and give help when the occasion demands. He is able to compete with others merely for the pleasure of testing his own resources. He is not unconsciously driven to compete, for the satisfaction of compulsive needs for success, revenge, admiration, or power. He can defend himself when attacked or insulted. He knows when decisions are necessary. Healthy self-development enables a person to recognize and tolerate the similarities and differences that exist between himself and others, without losing sight of his own individuality. This helps him respect the individuality of others. He can make honest comparisons which do not appreciably disturb his inner equilibrium. Such observations are used in the interest of his further self-development, rather than as a gauge of his relative superiority or inferiority.

Does the twenty-first birthday make a person aware of his civic responsibility? Some of us may have heard youngsters in their teens admonished by their parents this way: “Act your age!

From analytic experience, we have ample evidence indicating that rigidity in a person’s responses is related to the strength of the neurotic defenses necessitated by basic anxiety, and these defenses can be as powerful in the very young as in those who are considered old. We can conclude, therefore, that chronological age is not a valid criterion for the adequacy of an individual’s capacity to understand the nature of responsibility. We need to establish better criteria for determining the extent to which a person is able to assume responsibility for himself and actions.")]),a("p",[e._v("To this point, we have sketched the maturing process under favorable influences. Analytic experience provides us the valuable data about the subsequent development of the individual whose earlier experiences were detrimental to healthy growing-up. In childhood, such a person would develop dependent on adults whose own self-development was impaired. As a result of their compulsive needs and unresolved conflicts, such adults were unable to appreciate the real need and factual weakness of the child. In various ways, they frustrated his attempts to develop his own resources. They may have expected too much of him or too little. They may have given him too much praised and encouragement, they may have ridiculed or disparaged the child’s efforts to earn and grow. Instead of allowing the child to develop his own resources, they imposed their decisions, views, feelings, and prejudices on him. As a result of these unfavorable influences — it would take too much space to elaborate on them — the child develops basic feelings of worthlessness and unacceptability. He also feels without resources in this environment, which is actually inimical to his real needs, and does not accord him the right to develop himself. These feelings are covered by the term “basic anxiety,” which also includes feelings of hostility toward the grown-ups on whom the child is dependent.

Just as the healthy child can integrate himself, on the base of solid self-confidence, so the child we have been describing above attempts to achieve a false sense of inner unity on a basis of anxiety. He has to use his resources in the interest of safety. Original, neurotic defenses against basic anxiety necessitate reinforcement and false illusions to further developing conflicts — both within himself and with his environment. The neurotic structure which is developed to protect the maturing individual against basic anxiety — that is, against experiencing it consciously — is enlarged during adolescence and adult life as his own needs expand and more demands are made on him. The ultimate result of this protective defensive structure are an increase in basic anxiety, greater distortion of an individual’s self-evaluation, and further impairment in human relations. In short, the very defenses needed in early life that retard impairment of self-development only serve further to weaken an individual’s strength as long as he continues to maintain his neurotic defenses in later life, when original unfavorable influences are no longer operating.

Ameliorating factors are no doubt more effective during the earlier years, or at least, before the person has had the need and time to reinforce his neurotic defenses against anxiety. However, we have sufficient substantiating evidence from analytic experience for our belief that a person can begin to develop a healthy self at any age after dispensing with the destructive forces which he has been perpetuating. Naturally, the more time and need we have had to strengthen our neurotic defenses, the more work will be required to dispense with them. The outlook is brightened by the fact that many of us can and do function fairly realistically, and even successfully, in some areas, despite internal emotional disturbance. Few of us, indeed, have had the earlier ideal conditions which promote healthy self-development. As a result, most of us have, in the course of time, built up a strong protective structure to defend ourselves, both against ourselves and others. As we have said before, such a structure further impairs healthy maturing. Such impairment may vary in degree, and at times produce only minor inhibitions in functioning here or there.

The question “Who am I?” usually creates at least a mild confusion. Where the extent of impairment in function of the self is more severe, panic may be felt at the questioning of identity. One man recently told me that for one year, in his late teens, he went around feeling as if he were in a maze, absolutely unaware of his identity. What does this range of reactions indicate? First of all, inability to identify oneself implies alienation from an awareness of one’s feelings. A neurotic individual is unaware of an inner spontaneity of feelings. Of course he has feelings, but he does not experience them as stemming from within himself. He attributes them to others, or regards them as reactions to external experiences, pressure, and events. For example, the weather is responsible for his rise in spirits. The partner makes him angry. The recession in business has caused his depression. Insufficient sleep makes him irritable. Or some misdemeanor on a child’s part becomes the main cause of parental friction, irritation, and anger. So believes the individual who has no identity for himself. This estrangement from an awareness of one’s own feeling contributes to a person’s feeling of helplessness, and inability to assume responsibility for them, and excludes him from a sense of participation in living. The perpetuation of false illusions of conflict increases the alienation from himself and diminishes the capacity for enjoyment. A woman of forty, for example, insisted for many months in analysis that what her husband did and said was the main source of her anger at him.

Indeed, the wide (and, I predict, enduring) applicability of Horney's theory may be partly the result of the fact that it describes the human complications and variations of some of the most basic strategies of defense in the animal kingdom--fight, flight, and submission.

Horney\'s real self bears some resemblance to Kohut\'s "nuclear self" (1977, 1984) and even more to Winnicott\'s "true self" (1965). According to Winnicott, as a result of inadequate nurturing "something that could have become the individual becomes hidden away . . . protected from further impingement" by a "false self" that develops reactively and supersedes "the true impulsive self which might under more favorable circumstances have been gathering strength" (1987, 61). This sounds like Horney, as does much of Alice Miller\'s discussion of the loss of and search for the true self in childhood (1981, 1983) and R. D. Laing\'s account of ontological insecurity (which is comparable to basic anxiety) and the development of a false-self system in response to it (1965).

The chief spokesman for Third Force psychology is Abraham Maslow (1964, 1968, 1970, 1971), who knew Horney, adopted her conception of the real self, and developed a theory that is complementary to hers. Although modern psychology had been most influenced by the Freudian and the experimental-positivistic-behavioristic schools, Maslow felt that various other groups were "coalescing into a third, increasingly comprehensive theory" (1968, vi) with a different philosophy of human nature. The difference has been defined in a number of ways--greater optimism, a more holistic approach to human behavior, a richer array of inherent needs and values; but most crucial is the contention that in addition to tension-reduction and conditioning we are motivated by an evolutionary constructive force that urges us to realize our potentialities. We all have an intrinsic nature that it is our object in life to fulfill. Whether they call it self-actualization, self-realization, integration, psychological health, individuation, autonomy, creativity, or productivity, Third Force psychologists agree that the highest value for human beings is to become "fully human," everything they "can become" (145).')]),a("p",[e._v("Horney's ideas about the real self are at once foundational to her theory and the most elusive and controversial aspect of it, especially in the current postmodern climate.

I believe that Horney's vision of the self is solidly based in clinical experience (see my essay on this topic - posted on this website--in the June, 1999 issue of The American Journal of Psychoanalysis) and that it provides a far better basis for psychotherapy than the postmodern models. The contrast between Horneyan and postmodern versions of psychotherapy is too big a topic to take up here; but postmodernism has not necessarily arrived at the truth, despite its illusions to the contrary, and Horney should not be dismissed because she is out of step with its very dubious versions of human nature.

The cultural expectation that women, but not men, must care for others closes men off from their humanity, places a lopsided burden upon women, and makes male-female mutuality impossible (J. B.

Consequently, the daughter\'s mother-attentiveness is reinforced, promoting in her "the basic sense of \'learning to listen,\' to orient and attune to the other person through feelings" (Surrey, 1985, p. 4).

According to this interpretation, the self-in-relation finds acceptance from others through displaying the altruistic qualities of "unselfishness, goodness, generosity, humility, saintliness, nobility, sympathy" that she believes will win her love (Horney, 1950, p. 222). These are the shoulds of her defensive system: doing for others, caring for them, making their needs the sources of her motives, complying with others\' demands for recognition. Because her safety lies in appearing empathetic, the self-in-relation needs others to need her as a way of bolstering her self-esteem (Horney, 1937, pp. 109-112). She also needs them to reflect back to her that she is, indeed, her idealized self (Horney, 1945, p. 16). Thus, what Surrey (1987) celebrates as the "motive for connection" (p. 9) is, in effect, a compulsion for confirmation that the self- in-relation is, indeed, empathetic, caring, lovable. As Horney observed, the individual who needs others to mirror herself in this way abhors isolation. She believes that she "is worth as much as ... [she] is liked, needed, wanted or loved" (Horney, 1950, p. 227).

Failure to be caring enough or sensitive to others' feelings can incur the wrath of the idealized self-image, fostering a compulsion to live up to the shoulds. Nevertheless, one who is dominated by the idealized self cannot escape its wrath. The combination of defensive perfectionism and inevitable shortcomings serves to make anger against the self a permanent feature of character (Horney, 1951).

Stalin personally edited the glorifying Short Biography of himself published in 1947, and in so doing "marked the very places where he thought that the praise of his services was insufficient. Thus he inserted the following sentence: "Although he performed his task as leader of the party and the people with consummate skill and enjoyed the unreserved support of the entire Soviet people, Stalin never allowed his work to be marred by the slightest hint of vanity, conceit, or self-adulation." He also added this one: "Comrade Stalin\'s genius enabled him to divine the enemy\'s plans and defeat them. The battles in which Comrade Stalin directed the Soviet armies are brilliant examples of operational military skill."')]),a("p",[e._v('Stalin created Stalin prizes but no Lenin prizes, Khrushchev added, noting that "not even the Tsars" created prizes named after themselves.

In 1958 I finished and def ended my dissertation on Marx and became a teacher of Soviet politics, first at Indiana University and later at Princeton. Finally, in 1964-65, I had a year of academic leave at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, and with it the opportunity to work on Stalin.")]),a("p",[e._v("There was only one problem: I didn't know how to carry out the task. My aim was to write a political scientist's tact on dictatorship from a psychological perspective, not a Stalin biography. The idea came of constructing the study as a scholarly whodunit, and I wrote a 50-page first chapter entitled \"The Making of a Dictator.\" Starting with Stalin's ascension to supreme leadership in 1929, it showed how me made himself an autocrat by his terroristic purges of the 1930s.

True, his wretched early family life, the brutal beatings inflicted on his mother and on him by his drunken father, would easily have produced the basic anxiety that forms the psychological soil in which a neurosis can grow. Biographical interpretation could and should take this into account. Further, what was known of Djugashvili's boyhood showed a definite streak of self-idealizing, which continued during his years in the Tiflis theological seminary when he entered the local revolutionary underground, and subsequently as well. He definitely was neurotic.")]),a("p",[e._v('Instead of dealing in such abstract categories from a book of psychology, however, I was now using that book as guidance in a biographer\'s effort to portray his subject as an individual. More work brought to light Djugashvili\'s discovery, in Lenin, of a heroic identity-figure who inspired him to adopt a Lenin-like revolutionary pseudonym, "Stalin," or man of steel, as the symbol of his idealized revolutionary self. Here I was making use of Freud\'s concept of "identification," a process which "endeavors to mold a person\'s own ego after the fashion of the one that has been taken as a model." But, again, the concept was being applied in the context of biography.')]),a("p",[e._v("The Lenin-identification carried momentous implications for an understanding of Djugashvili's personality, among them the fact that he would feel driven one day to match or outdo his identity-figure in revolutionary accomplishment of world-historic importance. Earlier on, the Lenin-identification resulted in the Russification of Djugashvili's national self-consciousness. Since the identity-figure was a Russian revolutionist, he must be Russian too, and yet the Russian revolutionary persona that he thus fashioned for himself as Stalin was inevitably going to be in conflict all his life with his ineradicably Georgian empirical self as Djugashvili. This disparity, which had political consequences both large and small, was fated to be an inner conflict of the sort that Horney had found to be one of the normal vicissitudes of neurotic life.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now one could begin to see how Stalin would necessarily come into murderous conflict with many fellow Old Bolsheviks and others who were aware not simply of his original national identity but, more importantly, of the spotted actuality of his character and his revolutionary past.

This is amply documented by other sources. "Physical pressure" meant torture. Stalin was determined that those labeled enemies must be tortured.

Certainly he was one of them.')]),a("p",[e._v("The real mystery to me is no longer Stalin's thoughts and actions, but why some old associates failed to lift a hand against him while it was still possible to prevent him from going on his murderous spree through Soviet society in the later 1930s.

They must have known then that Stalin, like a mad dog, had to be destroyed. They still had access to him, they sat around the table with him at Politburo sessions. Sometimes in the quiet of my study I have found myself bursting out to their ghosts: \"For God's sake, stab him with a knife, or pick up a heavy object and bash his brains out, the lives you save may include your own!\" (Kuibyshev died under mysterious circumstances in early 1935 and Ordzhonikidze was forced by Stalin to commit suicide in early 1937.)")]),a("p",[e._v("Untold hundreds of thousands of Communist and other lives could have been saved, and untold damage to the Soviet Union averted. Take the behavior of Mikhail Tomsky, to whose apartment Stalin went with a bottle of wine in 1936, according to Roy Medvedev's oral-history evidence, very probably to solicit Tomsky's help in the contemplated purge trial of his ex-rightist associates Bukharin and Rykov.

Might it not blind one to the constructive accomplishments of that decade under Stalin's leadership of the country? It could do that, but it need not, for even criminals, the biggest ones in fact, can make positive contributions to the community in their careers of crime and, indeed, as a logical concomitant of the courses of action on which they are embarked.")]),a("p",[e._v("A final qualification is, however, in order. Stalin was despicable as a man and ruler, but he didn't know it. He did not see himself as the villain of history that he was -- or so I believe. The Stalin biographer must, therefore, be most careful not to attribute to his historical villain a consciousness of his own villainy. In the effort to reenact the villain's thought, he must be able to see and if possible to show how the villain managed to reconcile his duplicities and his most cruel deeds with the inner picture of himself as a righteous man and a good and noble ruler.

At this time, changes of great magnitude occur from relatively slight influences. The dependent and boundless nature of the infant makes it imperative that psychological alterations occur if he is going to become a whole-hearted member of the community. Lack of definition of the self is held responsible for this boundlessness of the infant. Evidence to indicate what this means comes from observations made of the child’s conception of the universe and his use of language. For example, the explanation of movement outside himself is, at first, not comprehended as such, but as a property of himself. Later, he will attempt to scale precarious fences not out of bravado or courage, but because he does not know his own limits or the power of outside forces, such as gravity.")]),a("p",[e._v("Lack of comprehension of limits applies in interpersonal relations as well.

The world into which he comes is one of cultural patterns, of history, of forces, and, more importantly, of people who also are engaged in this process of living. If life is to go on, this new infant and those he joins must establish some kind of a working relationship. Since parents in our culture are the most immediate and significant relations, we can approach the question of the origin of neurosis from this angle. You can see from this orientation that blame for neurosis cannot be placed on anyone if the goal of both the child and the adult is the same. Here, we are speaking broadly of the goal to live. However, the adult must be held responsible, if we speak in terms of responsibility.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now let us examine, in broad categories, some of the major efforts parents make to live, and see how these affect the growing child. You will recall these three categories which describe basic orientations toward life: moving toward, away from, and against people. This can be broadened to include all problems. These orientations can be described as compliance, aggression, and detachment. You are also aware of the fact that these movements can be healthy and necessary, and if properly exerted, comprise healthy relationships. However, one move is often dominant, rigid, and compulsive, while others become repressed, although effective. For example, a compliant individual represents a façade of geniality, appeasement, and closeness to people; detachment and aggressiveness seem to be absent. But compulsive compliance has its fee, and usually bears subtle demands which dominate others quite thoroughly. This is a picture of a person who seems so accommodating, whose philosophy is extremely ethical, who raises friendship to a virtue, but who wrests from his associates the strictest obedience.")]),a("p",[e._v("A compulsively compliant parent might say to his child, “You see? I do everything for you! Therefore you must do everything for me” — and what is more — “in order that I do not have to be assertive with my demands, you must anticipate them, or else you are an ungrateful wretch.” Now, what happens to such a child in relation to a parent? The first implication, “I do everything for you,” is in itself a disastrous thing even if it were not accompanied by the other demands. The child is effectively prevented from experiencing his own strength or developing his own resources. If he should make an effort, he is thwarted, since he his success would mean that the parent is useful. The next implication is this: “I am here, ready and able to do for you, and in return you must forgo your own strength and initiative, without a murmur.” The manifestations of this are legion, and are concealed beneath a host of acceptable rationalizations. Here is a child who wants to dress himself, but is not permitted, because, mother can do it more neatly, daddy is waiting, or grandma is coming and is so fussy, or “you’re too young now, and if you watch me a few more times, you’ll be able to do it perfectly yourself,” or “children shouldn’t be rushed into things, and failure for them is so discouraging.” Beneath this reasoning is a need that the child be completely dependent on the parent and accepting of what he offers.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, when detachment is the parent’s major orientation toward life, the child is confronted with another obstacle to his growth. This is dramatically illustrated in the case of twelve-year-old Helen. Helen, an only child, wrote a letter in which she pleaded for the return of a foster sister. Her mother, who was under the impression that she was bringing evidence which applied only to her daughter, showed me two letters which began as follows: « Dear Mother and Father, I am writing because you never listen when I talk. I want you to bring Joan back — otherwise, my life is useless.

In a sense, the child needs something outside himself against which to bang. If parents are insubstantial zephyrs, he plunges into a bottomless pit, hitting or contacting nothing. He feels alone, isolated, thrown on his own resources. Since his resources are limited, and he is unrelated to others, he becomes anxious and detached.")]),a("p",[e._v("The child whose parent is predominantly aggressive meets other obstacles to his growth. A crass example is where tenderness toward the child is never expressed or felt, or the angry voice, or the male fist express the only means of communication. This child cannot avoid a feeling of helplessness, worthlessness, and fear when he measures himself by such brutality and power. There is usually a double standard of values applied, in which assertiveness is the prerogative of the adult. The child may assert himself only when he is commanded to do so. For instance, the father will regale his family with his exploits against his schoolteachers when he was a boy, but just let his son come home with a “D” in deportment. In many instances, aggression and assertiveness in the parents enervates the child so much that he becomes compliant and submissive.

The neurotic predominantly feels some variation of self-contempt and humiliation. His efforts are inevitably directed to minimize these feelings to the point of emotional deadness.

Not a word passes between them. Then, each rises and leaves. In those minutes, something happened between two people. Each drew strength and warmth from the other to endure the parting and the uncertainties of the absence. These same feelings can transpire through a glance, a handshake, or a deed.

The man listens, reaches out his arms and uses his nose to seek relationships with the outside. We cannot say that the child tries consciously to do these things, but parents — analogues to the objects in the dark room — can make these reference points available to him.")]),a("p",[e._v("Our civilization is verbal and intellectual. A consequence of this prevailing condition is an impaired feeling atmosphere for the child. Frequently, one hears that an infant is so uninteresting.

Mothers are guilty of the same lack of interest, but cultural demands often cover up for her. Numerous studies in institutionalized infants bring confirmation of the ravages of this deficient contact. The same disaster is produced in the natural home as well, although it is often concealed by a variety of esteemed disguises. There was a time when child psychologists and pediatricians thought that a crying should be left unhandled in scheduled feedings. Today, we realize that the child is in need of an outside contact when he reaches out with one of his few instruments — his voice. He should not be disregarded.")]),a("p",[e._v("In this age of cliff-dwellers with small apartments and city traffic, the crib, the carriage, the playpen, and the harness provide a double-edged sword. Surely, each of these contrivances has its use and value. But the world becomes artificially constricted for the child under the guise of “convenience” or “protection.” His contacts are minimized; his experiences are lessened. He may become a big frog in a little pond, but he has to live in a big pond if he is going to be healthy. Destructive feelings, as well as positive ones, can seep out in spite of an appearance of warmth. This is illustrated in the following interviews of three fathers of three very disturbed adolescent boys. Each child was a disappointment to his parents, and each was able to hurt his parents by expressing a sharp contempt or disrespect. All the fathers complained, “I have done everything for my son. I have given him an education finer than mine. Now he gives me nothing! I don’t want gratitude — I don’t even care if he respects me. But he should at least respect his mother. I’d cut off my hand before I’d hit him, though. The last few words were accompanied by a gritting teeth, a flushed face, and a dramatic gesture. These are fathers whose aggressiveness is severely repressed. Aggressiveness is often concealed by a pride in reasonableness or kindness; however, wrath and anger emerge from these honeyed words, and cannot be hidden from the discernment of feelings.")]),a("p",[e._v("Culture can be a factor in causing neurosis. It is another relationship which influences the development of character. Dr. Horney’s first book — The Neurotic Personality of Our Time — excellently appraises this. Before we decide whether culture is a factor, though, we must be careful not to externalize. We must avoid seeing inner conflicts of the parents and the child as being external. We must bear in mind the intimate and dynamic relationship which life holds; that a single unit is the synthesis of many experiences; that there is an experiencer as well as there are experiences. If parents, and those who are closest to the child in his early years are ideally healthy, the child’s experience with the outside world in later years should have little negative effect upon his character. Since this is not so, external or cultural factors do have a more significant effect.")]),a("p",[e._v("Too often, we encounter children who at the age of eight are “little old mothers,” and who have been mothered themselves by their twelve-year-old sisters. This is what one finds in large families in our present culture. Mother is always pregnant, and children succeed each other in monotonous sequence, because of ignorance, law, or religion. Regardless of how healthy the mother was at first, certain real facts prevent her from being a very effective parent. Father, who was rarely ever able to support his large family, is subjected to stresses which tax what health he may have. As each child can assume household tasks, he is necessarily pressed into service. He misses out in play, and in important extra-curricular socializing. The strained economic circumstances mean that he has to leave school early even though he has aspirations for higher education. Or if one of the children is chosen to go ahead, the others must submerge their own wishes, to live vicariously through the advancing echelon of the family. Parents who have the time frequently do not have the capacity to influence the child constructively, and external experiences become more meaningful. It is then that the school, where the child spends large part of his day, becomes a significant factor. If he lives in a city like New York, he is one of a tremendous class, and may experience the relationship of as many as five teachers in one year. The positive quality he may gain in such a situation is minimal.

There is no playground for him, or no neighborhood center worth his name, perhaps. There is only an overcrowded school, manned by embittered, biased, and underpaid teachers. It would be wrong to blame such entirely cultural factors for delinquency of the child, but it would be incorrect to leave them out. Cultural contradictions create and amplify inner conflicts. They have their roots in our competitive economy; in racial and religious intolerance. They grant privileges to wealth. Intelligence is esteemed as a value, but it is frequently wasted by the community and passed over in favor of political expediency. Age and sagacity is revered, but a man of forty is often threatened with the loss of his job, and finds that there is no other place that he can use his knowledge. He sometimes discovers that he is no longer a useful member of society. Children are affected by these cultural patterns and contradictions.")]),a("p",[e._v("A more realistic definition of “self” is the process of growth. This process allows one’s relations to others to be whole-hearted, and self-esteem to be felt. Genetically, the individual experiences interpersonal relations.

It is necessary, however, to point out how the growing individual continues to create an unhealthy or hostile world long after the realistically hostile world which bred him has receded into the past. These are the wages of neurosis, and the self-fertilized soil which makes it flourish.

Another child finds that squalling and destructiveness attracts attention, even though it is of a punitive nature.

But when the world is hostile to him in the beginning, one of the moves becomes dominant and the others repressed. It is obvious that an individual who is dominantly one or another of these three types is not going to accommodate himself easily to changing needs and relationships. Since the basic orientation used is vital to his safety needs, it becomes an imperative and compulsive, rigid movement. In this way, a world not hostile can become a potentially hostile one. The aggressive child will definitely bring retribution from the community; the compliant child will get himself involved with people who will take advantage of him, or he will attempt things which are beyond himself, and the odds will then seem overwhelming to him; the detached child, by his very move, isolates himself from hostile elements as well as from the warmth and security that comes from being with people.

Then his needs to live with other people, reality, and his repressed moves become apparent, and jam up this rigid pattern. In this fashion, the compliant child finds his hidden aggressiveness cropping up and conflicting with his compliant trends. An inner conflict develops when a person discovers that he isn’t as easy-going as he thought he was. A frantic, anxiety-ridden conflict develops with a realization, perhaps unconscious, that the safety device — for instance, his compliance — may not be working. The individual is continually trying to maintain a measure of unity and self-esteem, however spurious. He finds his major solution threatened from within; he may externalize to reduce the disintegrating effect of the conflict and say, “I am an easy-going person, but one has limits when people — other people — are so nasty.” He may resort to another course of action, and subtly change the basic orientation to a more complex one.

Other writers give a physiological-limited childhood, that is, when puberty begins. But we avoid a real understanding of child development if we attempt to make a division between childhood and adulthood on any mechanical basis, such as age or grade in school. And if we limit ourselves to certain physiological changes which mark puberty, we are also making a division which is not in accord with reality.

You well know that development never ceases, and so you might say that this definition of childhood would apply to all ages.

He must still consolidate and extend this self, and is much more vulnerable to profound changes of a constructive and destructive nature.

This is a pessimistic, practically misanthropic point of view. It is not necessary here to dilate on the arguments against this approach to understanding child development. However, I should mention that this classical approach is limited by its emphasis on inherent, rigid, though modifiable instincts, only casually related to our culture. It is an exclusively biological approach. For us, development is biological and cultural, and both aspects are intimately related — not one primary, and the other secondary, both — are the matrix of growth. An individual is not a grasping, receiving type of person because he had inadequate oral gratification in his suckling period, but he’s this way rather because this is his solution to many relationships which have left him dissatisfied. An individual does not become sexually promiscuous because he was sexually stimulated as a child, but because he finds this the only way he can approximate the expression of his self — being unable to do so in any other area.

Immediately, conception occurs; a new relationship develops. All the emotions of the husband and wife become re-oriented toward the pending event. The child is wanted, or not wanted. The question of fear at a new responsibility, or pride in the coming heir, or dismay that another bond is being established that will make severance from a difficult situation less possible, comes to the fore. And it is not only in the are of consciousness that these factors appear, but we known the profound effect approaching parenthood has in stirring up conflicts, probably unconscious, whose pseudo-solutions are now being threatened.

If so, is this not a burden far too heavy to place on the shoulders of a little being already grappling with a big task? Is the relationship of the one parents to the other so dependent that the child becomes an intruder, and therefore is forced to compete with a more experienced adversary? Does the parent feel so inadequate and powerless that the child — a weaker one — becomes the only person the parent can dominate, and so the recipient of the whole of the parents’ hostility? Does the father, in his own pseudo-solved life, reject the mother? And does the latter, in desperation, turn to the child for the fulfillment she cannot get normally? Or — and if I have expressed too many sordid relationships, first, I have to point to unfortunate reality as blame — are the parents mutually fulfilled, spontaneous, expressive selves for whom the child is another manifestation of their creativity? A child of this latter relationship, as we shall see, will have problems, but he is in a much better position to solve them.")]),a("p",[e._v("Here is a situation which is quite prevalent among families in which mother was a budding careerist prior to marriage. She desires marriage and wants to have children. She discusses all the pros and cons with herself and with her husband, and the arrangement arrived at is that she shall become pregnant and start start the family for, after all, a woman, to be fulfilled, should have children, she says. But as she approaches term, she has to leave her job. And even though it’s called a leave of absence, a shadow begins to appear on the horizon. The months after delivery are full ones, bringing new joys, new problems, new relationships. But somehow or other, this new relationship and the changes made in the pre-mother relationship don’t seem to satisfy. Being, for her, a mother, is not as gratifying as being a wife and a careerist. Baby grows, goes to nursery school as all the neighbors’ children do; mother reads all the books on child care, she believes in giving the child responsibility when he can accept it. In short, she does everything possible, consciously, to be a good mother. But the thought of ever having a second child never enters her mind — or if it does, it’s abhorrent. And getting back to business, and away from domestic activities, looms as beauteous as Shangri-La. No matter how admirable are the conscious goals of the mother, unconscious needs keep hers an only child.

Here’s a thumbnail sketch of his father: he is a very successful person in business, but his apparent success has to be constantly fortified by what Veblen has called so well, “conspicuous consumption.” A more homely expression would be “keeping up with, and exceeding, the Joneses.” Therefore, to prove to the world that he is successful in his personal, as well as his business life, he has to become a parent. But the child becomes only one more person in the world with whom a relationship has to be established. And, as the relationships one establishes usually follow the same pattern, son Michael must be impressed, too, by his father’s success and greatness. Son gets the most expensive clothes and fishing tackle, but he cannot recite a single exploit of his own without having to hear about “When I was a boy … .” When visitors are in the home, Michael’s only importance is as the object of his father’s boasting. And usually, the achievements attributed to Michael are false and exaggerated. The demands made on Michael to approximate this false image far exceed his abilities, and he has before him constantly the falsity which makes up the veneer of his father’s life.

The Bible records that the sins of the father shall be visited on the sons. It is a commonplace that children mirror their parents. Is it not logical, then, for parents who wish to assay their work to look at their children as mirrors? When we know what to expect of our child, we should be able to recognize when something is wrong. If something is wrong, as shown by the child’s behavior, then we should ceaselessly examine the possible cause. And from our discussion already, you can see that the first point of focus must be yourself and your partner as a parent. If we are honest with ourselves, the first step in correcting the defect is made by this type of self-scrutiny. Sometimes, professional aid is necessary, but more often than not, difficulties in the parental relationship to the child can be worked out within the family. So many of the problems arise from superficial things or mere ignorance. Just learning, for instance, that one does not spoil a child by picking him up or rocking him when he cries is often sufficient to remove the greatest source of sleepless nights. Just learning that children normally find their sexual organs and investigate them in a masturbatory-like manner is often enough to eliminate embarrassment and its traumatic restraint of the child.

The obvious practical aspect of this is that in breastfeeding, or in bottle-feeding, the child is to be held, caressed, and not merely placed in juxtaposition to the breast or the propped-up bottle.")]),a("p",[e._v("The first independent action by the infant is the pattern for his whole development. He grows by the maturation of countless biological patterns and their mutual integration. Think of the process of grasping: directed arm and hand movements. Then, control of his lower limbs, in creeping and crawling; then finally, the complete integration of the graceful propulsion that involves swinging arms, balanced body, and striding legs. He grows by the establishment of relationships — his right hand to his left hand, his separate body parts to the integrated whole. The child grows further by the establishing of relations to objects external to himself — to his doll, or his crib; to his mother or father, or siblings. And throughout all this growth, there are before him the examples of other people who are weak or strong, affectionate or rejecting, honest or sincere, helpful or thwarting. These examples are, first, entirely within his family. Later, they become the kids in school, the radio serial, the comic book Superman, the teacher, and so on. The whole world is changing, as he is, and it is at once exciting, challenging, hostile, encouraging. Mother has to help here, too: just because crawling dirties clothes is no reason for confining the baby to the crib or to the carriage. Eating is another enterprise the child wants to attempt, and I don’t have to describe the mess that is bound to ensue. But the first consideration has to be that the child is trying to do something for himself, and not that the floor is a mess, and the clean dress has to be removed. And if you fear the child will not get enough to eat — an unlikely possibility if you give a large serving and assure its being thick enough so that at least some of it remains on the spoon — you can always help in the finishing-up process. Here is a point, however, where the parent’s own personality plays a great part. Some people cannot stand dirt — even to the point of developing nausea when baby’s cereal-smeared face is before them. Again, it is far less appetizing for the child to see the green face of his mother before him than to have the Pablum in his ears; and much more important for his own development that he be able to feed himself than not. If someone else can’t be present, or the child cannot be placed in a safe chair to eat alone, Mother just has to accomplish the difficult task of being in the room and just not looking.

In all this process, he is trying new things, gaining strength, finding himself. Through all this, his parents are his guides — his aids to progress or to retardation. For instance, when he asks, “Where do babies come from?” he is not trying to find out about the intimacies of mother and daddy; but he wants to know something about himself. This is his first investigation into history. When he wants to know why he has a penis and sister does not, he wants to learn more about himself, in relation to other people.

He also has a panic when, in playing, the other child wants him to be the patient or the bad boy who has to stand in the corner. Both these children show common features. Both find their calmest gratification alone: Susan, by her sucking and masturbating, and Charles, by his solitary play. In a sense, both have moved away from people to seek their satisfactions; for both, being with others is a threat; and both run away, while Susan also fights — that is, she moves against. And the guides for both these children have the same failing: both are more interested in being considered good mothers by their neighbors and by their grandparents than in actually being good mothers.

These children are usually so accommodating and humble that parents think they have a good child, and rarely see the need for help, but occasionally we see a child this at the clinic. Quite often, it is an anxious father who refers his youngster after his schoolmates have beaten him up a few times for being the teacher’s pet. The father has probably given the youngster a few pep talks first, and perhaps has even brought him some boxing gloves and gone a few rounds with him. But finally, ashamed and desperate, father brings the boy in and explains, “I was always able to stand up for myself, even against bigger fellows, but my son — I guess times have changed.” And then son Richard comes, maybe eight, or ten, or twelve, but he has the vocabulary of an adult. He talks in complete sentences, rivaling an orator. He stands until I sit, and rushes to open the door for me when we finish the interview. “No” is not in his vocabulary, and his head seems able only to nod affirmatively. We find that he has been praised whenever he behaved, and if he has strayed even the slightest, perhaps just to ask what “damn” means, he has been the object of a frown, a tea-time shriek, and a strong admonition that nice boys don’t use that word. We find that daddy has always boasted that his life was a hard one. He sold newspapers on the corner and had to fight to keep his corner against the other gang, but daddy conquered all and recognizes that fighting is not the only way, although by golly it’s a good thing he did. Now, because he fought his way to the top, Richard can have the best of everything. He won’t have to wake at five in the morning to sell papers — no, sir! — and mother nods in adoring agreement. What can Richard do in this situation? What a strong father have I, and how ungrateful would I be not to be glad I have all this, because daddy fought to get it for me. And look, mother says, that's a good thing too!

They are extreme examples from a psychiatric practice, but I believe they show trends that can be detected early by alert parents, and corrected before they get to the stage requiring professional help.

We must be willing to look into ourselves to see where we have erred, and to take the necessary steps to change. We must avoid the opiate, “he’ll grow out of it.” Knowledge is the key to being good parents. I speak not only of intellectual knowledge — although this, too, is important — but also of self-knowledge. It is provident to prevent problems, but it is never too late to correct them. One can look into himself, and with one’s partner, into the marital relationship; one can read about child care and guidance; and, if the need exists, professional advice can be sought.

Some children begin the changes of adolescence at ten, and by twelve, have undergone most of the structural changes which will occur; others begin at the same time, but the development will take longer; still others begin much later, and take the same fast or slow pace as those who began earlier. To further complicate the problems of the child, as well as of his parents, some children show a rapid and complete growth of muscle pattern and strength, and a retarded development of sex characteristics, for example.

He has been allowed to learn from a variety of sources — many of them culturally determined — that masturbation is wrong.

So if the parents prohibit masturbation, the child may consciously or unconsciously attempt to thwart them, and thus a pattern of compulsive masturbation might be started. The emergence of sex forces the adolescent to realize that a whole area of anonymity will have to be abandoned. A little girl must accept or reject her role as a girl, and her brother must deal with his role as a boy. The sexual impulses are constant reminders of the whole system which must be adopted.

She took an office position herself, and used all her money to buy clothes. She constantly spurred Paul on to achievement by pointing to his father as a horrible example. From early adolescence, Paul had to listen to recitals of the qualities which a woman desires in a man. At the same time, he had to hear about how to avoid the wiles of women who would try to enmesh him by seducing him and trapping him into marriage by imposing on his good nature. This unhealthy atmosphere was heightened by the mother’s unconsciously effective appearances around the house in her negligée, and by her request for assistance from Paul in fastening her intimate apparel.

Now, this was not a problem that began in adolescence, despite the fact that at that time, many manifestations became obvious. Nor is it solely a problem that affects sexuality — although it is in this area that many of Paul’s disturbed relationships emerged.

So he began to tell people that he was a college sophomore, though he was only in his second term of high school. With one part of himself, he believed that he could have entered college, except for a few bad deals from the teachers. Then came the war, and Paul had to lie again to explain why he was not in service. Actually, he was not old enough, but he had told so many girls that he was eighteen, that he could not avoid the inevitable question.

The purpose of my talk is to focus your attention on the powerful influence of family relationships in forming character and determining those human qualities known as “temperament” and “disposition.” Now medicine, and particularly, public health medicine, has made headway in determining and specifying and prescribing the physical factors essential for healthy growth.

There would, of course, be beneficial aspects as well, and the consideration of them would be the positive complement to the material given here.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, all children have problems in their family relationships, simply because children and parents are human — we do not hope for intrafamilial conditions without problems.

We can think of the conditions prevailing in the climate — let’s call it — the climate of the home. If harmful parental attitudes are present, and helpful attitudes absent, the climate will be severe. And it is then that we will have, as a result, serious deviations in the child’s pattern of living.")]),a("p",[e._v("Urgent problems make the child more compulsive and indiscriminate in his choice of solutions, and invariably produce more extreme behavior.

A former colleague of mine, the late Dr. James Plant of Newark, posed an important question: what are the eighteen or twenty fundamental problems of our children? Now, we can say, neglect, deprivation, rejection, overprotection, possessive love, over-solicitation, erratic discipline, male or female preference, favoritism, sibling rivalry.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, this is quite an arbitrary selection.

His efforts to cope with them are mainly unconscious. When parental attitudes are bad enough, they force the child to resort to all manner of solution. He tries ways out of his difficulties which are mutually incompatible, and which may or may not be socially acceptable. Now, in time, these conflicting strategies are unconsciously self-perpetuated, and operate in spite of the child, and whether he is faced with real problems or not. This is, in general, what we mean when we say that “he is compulsive and indiscriminate.” His habitual pattern becomes a compromise between various conflicting tendencies. It is in this way that neurotic character structures are formed.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, one factor that increases the likelihood of certain problems is the child’s position in the family. In some family constellations, the stage is set for one kind of family drama; other arrangements set the stage for a totally different interplay of human attitudes and emotions. These various family situations provide either a low risk, a moderate, or a high risk to the individuals involved. In some — let’s say “settings” — we are justified in expecting a tragic development, and serious deviations from the norm. An obviously high risk is produced, for instance, when the family presents a picture of father, mother, five girls and one youngest boy. Or, four boys and one girl. Or, several grown-up children, then a lapse of twelve or thirteen years, and then another child. Now, the only child also presents a good illustration of the formative influence of parental attitudes.

All attachment to a parent intense enough to justify the term “Oedipus complex” is to be understood as caused by excessive anxiety, due fundamentally to a severe home climate — an absence of the attitudes essential to growth, or the presence of hostility, or both.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, though the possibilities for danger in the settings mentioned above may seem quite obvious to you, yet most people do not see them — so very widespread is our adherence to a materialistic philosophy.

He is, as it were, the first experimental object for parental education and adjustment — the means of proving the basic philosophy of father and mother. Depending on their philosophy, he can become a source of satisfaction, or dissatisfaction; of reassurance, or of anxiety. The parents’ capacity for giving has its first test. It is their first experience in dealing with something helpless of their own, and all their hidden feelings relative to helplessness are activated. Many neurotic people have difficulty in really loving anything helpless. Then, again, the unconscious motives for marriage, for becoming pregnant and having a child, are also brought to the surface. When the motive for having a child is other than constructive — when, for example, it is due to insecurity, or to satisfy the need for someone dependent, or to prove potency or prowess — then the child must satisfy these hidden cravings. He becomes the focus of many neurotic trends and serves as a kind of vehicle whereby the father or mother attempts to resolve inner conflicts.

And, in overcoming these obstacles, he makes the way easier for his brothers and sisters. And there is certainly an analogous situation in his post-natal experience. Hidden conflicts in the parents regarding masculine and feminine, hidden standards, patterns, philosophies, are activated by the first child, regardless of its sex, and produce certain parental attitudes towards it that do not operate towards succeeding children. The three-cornered relationship takes up, to a certain extent, what may be described as the parents’ neurotic slack, and tends to immobilize — even resolve — certain of their neurotic attitudes and feelings. Then, hidden neurotic jealousies are most likely to be aroused by the advent of a first child, if the marriage has occurred on the basis of insecurity. And where, for instance, there exists the influence of a combination of possessive wife and dependent husband, the father will show open jealousy of the child, or more hidden reactions equally harmful to it.")]),a("p",[e._v("Much tension surrounds the first child; the mother is usually more perfectionistic — she is systematic, strict, and much less flexible in her habit-training. She shows her ambition to be in perfect health and produce a perfect child. With the second baby, her demands upon herself and the child are apt to relax. So, in general, the problem most likely to confront the first child is what we could call “exploitation.” He is the one who will be the victim of excessive parental demands and expectations. The greatest hopes and ambitions are attached to him. If the oldest child is a male, the whole tendency towards exploitation is strengthened, especially among racial groups having marked masculine preference, or in families with a very successful father, or in well-known families dominated by high traditions. Later children, can, of course, also be exploited, but it is generally done with much less intensity. Then, the oldest child has another problem that is peculiarly his, and indeed exclusively his. He experiences a unique kind of displacement — displacement when the second child is born. Later children invariably know their parents as people to be shared with others.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, the tremendous formative influence of this displacement seems to be constantly overlooked. There is no way of sparing the first child this difficulty. It is something he has to face; but because it is so widely ignored, it is made unnecessarily serious. This problem can be greatly emphasized and complicated when exploitive parents use the displacement as an occasion for increasing their excessive demands and expectations towards this older child. As soon as a second baby comes, some parents exert greater pressure on the older child to “act his age,” be grown-up. They express complete intolerance for his natural immaturity. Then, very soon, the older child learns to feel that unless he meets these demands, he cannot gain approval. He tends to relinquish his natural immaturity, his natural play and emotional expression, and to develop instead a pseudo-grown-up exterior.")]),a("p",[e._v("Before the birth of the second child, the elder at least received brute care — that is, it received, like any young, growing thing, warmth, nourishment, and support. But, after the second birth, the situation often changes to one in which brute care ceases, unless excessive parental demands are met. The child inevitably feels that all recognition, interest, affection, love, are exclusively conditional — something must be done to earn them. He must excel, comply, be brave, be grown-up, et cetera, in order to be loved.")]),a("p",[e._v("Then the seriousness of displacement is also increased when it occurs to a child who has had some degree of over-protection, over-solicitation, and pampering when he was the only one. The sudden shift from over-protection to expectation creates acute problems for any child — which calls for for very urgent solution. When insensitive parents, doctors, and nurses ignore and aggravate the problem of displacement by clumsy handling, the widest varieties of symptoms can result, such as bedwetting, sleep-walking, stammering, temper tantrums, convulsions, stealing, fabrications, aggressiveness, unusual shyness, sudden cruelty to animals, and reading and writing backward in school. The child’s symptoms disappear when the adults concerned are made aware of what they are doing and give the child the sympathy and care he needs, successfully to weather the displacement crisis.")]),a("p",[e._v("In many respects, however, the child who develops such obtrusive symptoms is really fortunate, for symptoms are, after all, a dramatic danger signal, and help attract attention to something wrong in the climate of the home. Far more unfortunate is the child who develops the subtler character changes which can be completely and permanently overlooked — changes which may appear to be socially acceptable and even commendable, but which are actually the beginning of an undesirable pattern adopted by the child in his effort to cope with the problem of displacement. The child becomes serious, prematurely grown-up, and all too ready to accept responsibility. Now, I do not speak now of the precocious smart-aleck child, but of the child who is a little old man before his time. He becomes a great help to his parents, looks after younger children, giving up much of his play life and childhood in the process. And so little do people realize the cause of such a development that they say of him, “Well, he’s just naturally a serious boy,” or, “It’s his nature to be that way,” or, “He has no sense of humor.”")]),a("p",[e._v("This last remark becomes, in time, an accurate, a very accurate description — for these older children who have been subjected to exploitation, and of whom much is expected, do finally tend to look on any emotion, and certainly on all expressions of emotion such as loud laughing or crying, as something they have grown out of. They feel, also, a great intolerance for whatever emphasizes youth — youthful ideas, innovations and changes of all sorts. They tend to be conservative. And then they give the general impression of being in a hurry to grow up. They are markedly intelletual, literal-minded, conscientious, meticulous. Very early, they begin to derive considerable gratification from having others dependent on them — particularly their younger brothers and sisters. By this means, they gain security. And unconsciously and inadvertently, they perpetuate dependence and weakness in others. People of this type who become leaders find it difficult to share leadership. Around them will gravitate those who are compliant, dependent, and obsequious. Because so much is expected of them — these oldest children — they may become afraid to initiate anything, through a dread of making mistakes. They dare not let themselves go. They are extremely sensitive to ridicule, and they develop a contempt towards the beginnings of early stages of everything — a contempt which is part of their intolerance of immaturity. The picture they present, in general, is that of a compulsively materialistic, practical philosophy toward life — a need for schedule, ritual, and routine living, and an urgent stringency in dealing with money matters.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, if I were to describe the character type of these exploited older children in Freudian terminology, I would say they have a severe superego development, and strong repressions of the id. As a result of excessive demands, the oldest child may develop a kind of unconscious strategy for discouraging the expectations of his family. When he succeeds in dashing his family hopes and ambitions for him, so that implicit demands cease and all pressure is removed, and everyone has given up hope of his ever accomplishing anything, then he may spring a great surprise and accomplish something out of the ordinary. He does well when losing, or when expected to lose, and when he is not in the limelight. As an athlete, he is very often the type who will, as we say, “tighten in the clinches.” So the personality traits that we have been describing are the result of exploitation. And they are given here in relation to the oldest child because he is apt to be exploited. Exploitation in itself is a form of rejection — rejection of the child — but specifically, it is a rejection of immaturity, and of the inchoate, unformed child.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, in contrast to the oldest child, the youngest is most likely to meet with the problem of overprotection. He is often referred to as the “baby,” and a great deal of babying does occur. But we should give our most careful attention to this process called “babying.” By the time the youngest child arrives, many of the parents’ conflicts, unconscious motivations, and high standards of expectation and excessive demands of the children have been more or less dissipated. The earlier children have to a great extent borne the shock of parental inexperience, and the parents are prepared to show much greater leniency towards this latest arrival. In complete contrast to the oldest child, very little is expected of the youngest, and parents and siblings often remark that he “gets away with murder.” His older brothers and sisters usually resent the greater tolerance and leniency shown him. Sometimes they vent their resentment on him directly, though generally when the parents aren’t around. Or they may express a desire to dominate very subtly, by overprotection of the youngest. They fight his battles for him, do more and more things for him, and so successfully prevent him from acting for himself that he becomes increasingly dependent on them. Perhaps not all of his siblings will take such an attitude, but there is very apt to be at least one among them who gains a great deal of satisfaction out of the dependency of the youngest, and will unconsciously foster and perpetuate it. This is part of the process known as “spoiling” — spoiling the child. Again, in complete contrast to the oldest child, the youngest does not experience displacement of any kind. He is the only one in the family who escapes the experience entirely.")]),a("p",[e._v("Another type of problem, which is often more serious for the youngest child than for the others, is that of rivalry with older siblings. He may come to feel that he can win love, affection, and recognition only if he equals or resembles one of his older brothers or sisters. This conviction, and the inequality of the competition can lead to an early withdrawal from all rivalry, and refusal to grow up. He is often afraid to grow up. He then retains immaturity as an asset — parades it, and tries to use it to dominate others. Over-protection of the youngest can result in crippling feelings of weakness and inadequacy, and in a constantly growing tendency to resort to immaturity as a means for controlling situations. Younger children may even retain an immature physique, an infantile makeup. They very often are sexually undeveloped, the girls menstruate late, and the boys are slow in showing male characteristics. They are apt to be much less conscientious than the oldest child, and more spontaneous and voluble and impulsive. Now, at the period of adolescence, many of these youngest children may show a seeming rebellion against the overprotection and dependence. “You’ve treated me like a baby,” they seem to say, “well, I’ll show you, I’m not a baby!” — Then, a wide variety of behavior patterns can result — all, apparently, motivated by the desire to prove strength, independence, and an adult status. But the independence is illusory, for underlying the defiance, a strong dependence persists. It’s just as if they remained all the time in the parental lap, but they showed periodic defiance by kicking the parent in the stomach. Youngest children are usually capable of close relationships and identify with the young growing things around them. They love animals; they revel in immaturity, and show none of the oldest child’s shame of it. They express their feelings readily; they are also apt to be more spontaneous, imaginative, idealistic, but they are impractical, and inconsiderate of others.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, again, if I can resort to Freudian terminology, they have a less rigid superego than the oldest child, and greater expression of id impulses. In simpler terms, the youngest child is really much more free in self-expression, and his deficiency is on the side of control and regulation. In dealing with the youngest — especially one who has brilliant siblings — parents should constantly ask themselves, “How is this child trying to compete, to dominate, to control?” Because, as I mentioned above, the youngest learns very readily, very early, the value of helplessness as a means of dominating the household, and uses this means either openly or indirectly. If the older siblings on whom the youngest is especially dependent are girls, he may develop a need to belittle women, to humiliate and frustrate and tease them. Where the older siblings are boys, the need will be to humiliate men, and make them feel ridiculous. Some very protected youngest male children who have been dependent on older brothers tend to withdraw from competition with men, and they become the type ofen referred to as “sissies.” Because of early dependency, these youngest children retain considerable weakness and fear of growing up. They remain, we say, at a perceptual level, and are unaware of any strength in themselves. They may resort to a fundamentalist type of philosophy, and they have to look always to an agency outside of themselves to protect and care for them, and then, towards whom they can be both compliant and defiant.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, sometimes, the extremely free self-expression fo youngest children brings with it great creative imagination. But they remain so unrealistic and impractical throughout life that this productive genius can be realized only within the framework of a very special relationship with someone else — someone like an indulgent, long-suffering, and possessive parent, who will tolerate their Olympian originality and their reactive defiance and compliance. Such a relationship resembles that already mentioned, in which an older child — the oldest — gains its only feeling of security and adequacy by unconsciously fostering dependency in the youngest.")]),a("p",[e._v("It often happens that much of great value created in these neurotic unions is aborted or still-born, unless a third party intervenes. He must be — that is, this third party — must be someone whose emotional security limits his neurotic involvement, and gives him enough objectivity and judgment to evaluate the unrealized potentialities of such a neurotic partnership. Only with his help can the brain-children of this partnership be delivered to the world with some hope of survival. Such third parties are to be found among those specializing in public relations, and among the promoters, sponsors, and angels of the artistic and literary world. But what I want specially to emphasize here is that this is a partnership that is sponsored, and not individuals. There are third parties whose interference is destructive, and who either unconsciously exploit the partnership, or fail to realize its full, creative possibilities. The ideal third party would be the prototype of the Homo dei that’s mentioned by Thomas Mann in The Magic Mountain — that is, one who is truly integrated, and therefore, above counterpositions, as Mann puts it, and whose function figuratively combines that of obstetrician, wet nurse, and foster parent. He realizes that it would be impossible for him to break up certain neurotic partnerships which are potentially creative. And his aim is not primarily therapeutic, but it’s an attempt to save what is valuable for mankind from an otherwise unproductive human relationship.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, in conclusion, I want to say that no one realizes more fully than I how very little of this whole subject has been presented here in this very brief talk.

Many factors have contributed to this decreasing trend. Some of the general ones are economic and social changes, alterations in family habit patterns, world chaos, and the extension and increased acceptance of birth control information.

Onlies had been considered to be characterized by their selfishness, hypersensitivity, self-centeredness, lack of initiative and self-reliance, and social awkwardness. Theorists have attributed these maladjustments to attitudes they consider are displayed specifically by parents of only children, such as excessive solicitude, overprotectiveness, and tendencies to be too restricting.

It has been gathered from my analytic practice and includes composite data on onlies, adults who were only children, and children and adults who occupied various birth positions in the family. This material is being considered in light of the theory of personality development elaborated by Horney. I might well begin with a brief introduction to the basic concepts involved: First, the basic assumption rests on our belief that every child who is born without physical or mental handicaps has potentialities for healthy personality development. Since personality acquires structure in a human environment, and in response to this environment, the psychological help of the adults in it exerts a decisive influence on the direction of the child’s personality development.")]),a("p",[e._v("Each child has its own unique personality requirements of growth and development, and its own capacities in striving. Also, in each human being there appears to be a deep basic need to establish satisfactory relations with people. This need expresses itself in three ways of moving in relation to people: toward people, in friendliness and for help; against people, to ward off harm, or domination, or in competition; and away from people, to pursue one’s goals, and for solitude. In an environment favorable to normal personality development, the adults are spontaneous and natural in their relation with people as a whole. Therefore, they can accept the child as he is: a factually immature human being, and appreciate his needs to develop, slowly and naturally. Not driven by conscious and unconscious, unfulfilled personality needs, such adults are not disturbed by the child’s uneven tempo of learning and the child’s attempts to develop his capacities for reasoning and judgment. They are not compelled to interfere, and can differentiate between conscious desires to be good, kind, and helpful to the child, and what is real assistance, guidance, and support for the child.")]),a("p",[e._v("The results, for the child, are that he acquires a solid inner feeling about his own importance as a human being, and a balanced picture of his assets and liabilities. He can also develop initiative and self-reliance, and the ability to become responsible for his decisions. Since the child is then equipped with the guideline for differentiation between friend and foe — between what is in his true self-interest and what is opposed to it, the child’s personality development is more likely to be healthy, and has a better chance for survival in the face of later, adverse influences. Since early childhood is the crucial period, for determining the direction of personality development, let us see what occurs adverse conditions, generally.")]),a("p",[e._v("First of all, in such a setup, the adults have personality difficulties or disturbances which interfere with establishing good relations with other people. For example, they may be driven by excessive ambition, or intense needs for affection or detachment, or influenced by their idealization of what a good parent should be. Unconsciously, such parents use the child to satisfy these needs — or at least some of them — and the child’s needs are actually disregarded. It is important to bear in mind that adults who have conscious or unconscious, unfulfilled, compulsive needs, although basically well-intentioned, cannot avoid having an impact about those around them, and unwittingly use their human relationships — whether with a child or with other adults — in the service of these compelling drives. Consequently, the child is not accepted as he is, and his capacities for normal development are stifled. For example, the child may not be accepted for himself, but becomes, unconsciously, a tool for the reflected glory he sheds on his parents, the vicarious neurotic satisfaction they may attain from his beauty, brilliance, health, or good manners. In other respects, his development and his needs may be taken for granted or partially neglected. In the unfavorable family milieu, where parents are disturbed in their human relations, the child must of necessity sacrifice and neglect his own strivings for growth and development to the end of finding ways to relieve his anxiety in relation to his parents. This is the origin of neurosis in childhood.")]),a("p",[e._v("All movements, then, of the child in his human relations, become invested with compulsiveness and indiscriminateness. Under some circumstances, one form of movement predominates, and the others are repressed, but also operate, and determine feelings, and patterns of behavior and traits. If, for example the predominant movement of the child to relieve his anxiety is towards people, most of his energies are diverted in this direction, to win them over, at the expense of total personality development. Now, in the service of these movements, special needs are developed as well as special qualities. So you see, now, that the personality traits which are most in evidence in children — whether they are only-children or non-onlies — are merely representative of the predominant character trend; that is, the predominant way to cope with life and with people. Since both onlies and non-onlies are likely to be exposed to early adverse influences, we would not expect to find any one set of personality traits more characteristic of onliness than another set of traits. Wherever one form of movement predominates, we find corresponding traits. The selfishness and hypersensitivity which theorists consider characteristic of onliness are, in reality, characteristic of distorted personality development or neurotic difficulties. So they are [a] neurotic phenomenon common to all neurotic individuals. These traits are also, therefore, common to only-children. For instance, lack of self-reliance or excessive aggressiveness, or shyness and withdrawal, can be seen in the population as a whole. I have not noted that only-children display one form of movement in relation to people any more than another. The understanding of personality is considerably deepened by viewing separate aspects in the sphere of reference of the total personality structure. In the same way, we get a broader view of the factors influencing personality development if we keep in mind the totality of factors. I believe that, as in the case of personality traits, so you shall see, in what follows, that onliness in and of itself is just one factor, and a secondary one, in comparison to the effect of the adult’s personality strivings which influence the personality development of the child.")]),a("p",[e._v("Before focusing on the nature of the later adjustments made by the singleton, we shall retrace our steps to the period where the normal direction of the child’s personality development has been blocked by environmental pressures. This is the origin of the development of the neurotic personality. The neurotic structure elaborated has a force of its own, in opposition to the healthy strivings in the personality, toward self-fulfillment. The operation of the neurotic forces further impairs the individual’s functioning. This becomes more evident in one area or another — disturbed human relations may result, or lack of productivity in work, or psychosexual disturbances.")]),a("p",[e._v("With this understanding, let us proceed to look at the profiles of some only-children, with a view to investigating some of the sources of their maladjustments. I shall stress the family tone, and the feeling-tone between parent and child, both of which, I feel, far outweigh the factor of onliness in affecting personality development. Eve came into analysis at age of thirty because of dissatisfaction with her career adjustment and unsatisfactory relations with men. She was an only child. Her mother was a gentle, loving, and dependent person, with strong tendencies to subtle domination under the guise of self-sacrifice and felicitude. The mother focused endless attention on the physical welfare of the husband and child. Although she idolized her husband, and effaced herself for him, she was openly rejected by him. He was humiliating and belittling through his continual sarcasm and criticism. Eve’s mother then began to use Eve as her sole reason for living and main source of affection. To gain this affection, although unconsciously motivated, she assented to Eve’s every wish, catered to her and never found fault with her. Eve’s father, on the other hand, focused on Eve’s scholastic work, in which he expected top-notch performance. He gave her some human direction, in the form of pat, moralistic formulae; he preached respect and consideration for others and tolerance. The family tone, as you see, was sadly lacking in these qualities. Eve unconsciously registered these contradictions, as well as the parents’ lack of genuine interest in her real right to self-development. Her mother’s self-sacrificing trends were really domination, and her excessive attention to Eve was interference. Secretly fearing her father, Eve tried to woo him by her successes in school, developing intensive needs for approval which deprived her of real pleasure in studies, made her extremely competitive, and impaired her later success in school. Her neurotic need to succeed interfered with satisfactory relations with people, even though outwardly, she was compliant and submissive. Eve was entirely unaware of her hostile aggressive trends and dependency drives. After college, she became self-supporting and self-reliant, but felt unfulfilled.")]),a("p",[e._v("In her attempt to find a solution to her emotional problems through love, she married a weak, dependent man whom she dominated and secretly despised. The marriage ended in divorce. Subsequent relations with men were also unsatisfactory. She admired and feared strong men, who increased her feelings of inferiority. Until analysis, she was neurotically attached to her father, although he rejected her. This trend was analyzed. It was then found to be not on an instinctual basis, but found to stem from anxiety and guilt-feelings in having failed her father in his ambitious goals for her. This basis for Eve’s attachment to her father seems to be a sounder explanation than attributing it to an Oedipus-complex. Analysis helped Eve to see that she was worthwhile in herself, reduced her approval-needs, freed her for more productive work commensurate with her capacities, and improved her human relations.")]),a("p",[e._v("I am well aware that there were additional influencing factors. Those I have highlighted appeared to me of major importance. The mother’s subtle domination and self-sacrifice crushed Eve’s capacity for sharing, produced an inner feeling of not belonging, and also contributed to an exaggerated notion of her own importance. Her father’s subtle disparagement and overemphasis upon scholastic achievement, with frequent reference to the success of others, contributed to just as false a picture of inferiority. These factors played a large part in her impaired human relations, her intensive need for approval, and her lowered accomplishment in school. Her total personality development suffered under these influences more than from just the fact that she was an only-child. We might speculate that another child in this family milieu of friction and disrespect for human rights would also have been adversely influenced, even with the best consciously-avowed intentions on the part of the adults.")]),a("p",[e._v("Eve was overtly self-reliant, as we’ve seen. Now, Nan — another only-child — was openly helpless, clinging, awkward, and dependent. She was predominantly detached, with strongly repressed aggressive drives. Her mother was cold, perfectionistic, over-critical, and self-sacrificing, with a marked sadistic streak. Her father as a very kindly, non-interfering person, who had married mainly to have a home and good housekeeper. However, he provided for his family, and there his participation in the family group ended. He gave Nan practically no personal support or guidance. Nan’s mother subtly contributed to undermining the child’s self-confidence by being too helpful. She was unconsciously driven by her won impatience, and rarely allowed the child to complete a task at her own tempo. This was one of the major factors in crushing Nan’s incentive to persist in the face of obstacles. At the same time, Nan’s mother expressed disappointment that Nan was no great help in the house. The mother set great emphasis, as you see, upon a girl’s need to be a good housewife for future marriage. Nan’s lack of initiative and self-reliance, together with a horror of the consequences of making a mistake, contributed to mediocre work in school. Her actual accomplishments were below her capacities. She had deep inner feelings of stupidity, worthlessness, and having no right to live. Her primary early solution to environmental pressures was to submit, withdraw, and let her mother take over.")]),a("p",[e._v("Popularly, this might be regarded as “selfishness.” You see that it is not “selfishness,” but a neurotic phenomenon. In her choice of friends, she chose weak women and men, thus unconsciously satisfying her needs for superiority. She was unaware of her excessive expectations from life, and people, although she consciously felt very ill-treated. Before analysis, she had begun a search for a man who would literally put her in his vest pocket and thus provide protection for life. She had no realization of how she was blocking her own power to gaining satisfaction from living. When the need for helplessness was analyzed, strongly repressed ambitious strivings came into focus. Nan’s mother, also, would not have treated another child much differently. Her values, goals, attitudes, and patterns of behavior would not have been altered by another child. This example, again, bears out the thesis, that onliness in and of itself becomes relatively unimportant in comparison with the family tone and the feeling-tone between parent and child.")]),a("p",[e._v("It is true, hwoever, that the only-child is at a disadvantage, in that the only-child receives the full impact of the personality difficulties, neurotic needs, and distorted values of its parents, who unconsciously are driven to foist their needs and ideologies on the child.

It is mere coincidence that I have used two female adult onlies for illustration. Male onlies, and male adults who were onlies, are also affected adversely in proportion to the crushing parental influences, and present no striking differences in maladjustment from the females.")]),a("p",[e._v("Both male and female only-children may also suffer personality disturbances. For purposes of comparison, let us briefly consider Robert, who is the youngest of three. Both parents were overambitious, over-devoted to their children, self-sacrificing, and over-valued intellectual achievements. Robert was very bright and physically somewhat frail. On both scores, he received excessive attention — the rest of his personality development being taken for granted. Exposed to constant emphasis upon his brilliance, and repeatedly-expressed high expectations of extraordinary achievement, Robert developed an excessive need for success and admiration. Inwardly, he felt weak, since he had been unable, because of their outer and his inner pressures, to develop the stamina to persist in the face of obstacles. His success in school was far below his actual capacities. As he progressed, his accomplishments steadily decreased. He was entirely unaware of his fantastic demands upon himself and other people. His horror of producing work with any flaw contributed, in part, to his actual failure in fulfilling his potentials. He became progressively more unable to act on his own behalf, more hopeless, helpless, and dependent. Even when he did accomplish something, he was unable to get any satisfaction from this accomplishment because of his enormously high standards. This, in part, contributed to his feeling of being an utter failure. Again, he was unaware of his strong exploitive tendencies and his dependency drives. His energies were directed towards gaining approval and admiration, particularly from his parents, who condoned every deficiency. Similar attitudes were displayed toward the other children, but not to the same degree. Robert’s relationships with people were unsatisfactory. He was driven to select those who feed him admiration and permit exploitation. Secretly, he despised these weak people on whom he leaned, and to whom he gave little of himself. He had contradictory pictures of himself — as a person entitled to very special privileges, and a person without capacities for success.")]),a("p",[e._v("Although not an only-child, Robert, too, was unable to share or contribute to a relationship, and secretly expected to be accepted as he was, without realistic proof of his abilities, and to be protected. When the dependency trends and fantastic compulsive strivings were analyzed, Robert became productive, and fulfilled some of his own chosen standards, since he had the potential actually. He could allow himself to write, to work toward his goals, without a driving need for success, and a paralyzing fear of failure. Yes, Robert’s parents were very self-sacrificing, and they indirectly sacrificed Robert’s total personality development by focusing on one facet of the personality, and unconsciously neglecting the other needs of the growing individual.")]),a("p",[e._v("A survey of other material on only-children and non-onlies reveals a common thread in the family milieu and the parental attitude. In all instances, the adults were disturbed in their human relations, and the family tone was lacking in a spirit of mutuality and sharing. There was an absence of reliable warmth and friendliness, overemphasis upon one aspect of personality development, with disregard of other assets, and an unconscious disregard for the rights of human beings — whether children or adults — to be themselves and to choose their way of life. The parents were basically well-intentioned. Unaware of their own compulsive drives, they interfered with the child’s development either by impatience, excessive urging to live up to their expectations, inconsistent appreciation, being too helpful, too devoted, too self-sacrificing, too perfectionistic, or setting no goals for the child. Such attitudes and behavior result in the child’s feeling worthless, lacking in capacities, and rejected as he is. Natural incentive and initiative for growth and development, natural curiosity and courage, are crushed and buried under such influences.")]),a("p",[e._v("When one aspect of the child’s personality, or one goal, is stressed to the exclusion of others, as, for example, beauty, popularity, or scholastic achievement, the child feels he is no good as he is, and develops no feeling of significance as a total person, since he must devote his energies to gaining acceptance and approval in the particular area emphasized by the adults. Now, as to the feeling of not belonging, this is not particularly characteristic of the only-child. Self-sacrificing, interfering parents frustrate a child, prevent its participation in the activities of the family group, and inhibit the child from experiencing its own resources. They also prevent the participation of the child in his own activities. This feeling of isolation in later life is a further outgrowth of a total neurotic structure. Self-sacrificing parents also contribute to the child’s forming a dual picture of itself, as unusual, and also as inadequate. As one only-youngster said, “If they thought I could do it, they would not come along and help me so much when I’m trying to get it myself. I guess I should have done it. I guess I just can’t. Oh, I’m afraid to try.” Another adult, who was the sixth of nine children, recalled, “They always suggested what I should do, and said the others could do it. They asked me, why couldn’t I? It made me feel so stupid and worthless. So I gave up — it was no use.”")]),a("p",[e._v("On the other hand, unrealistic reassurance has its detrimental effects also on the child development of persistence and stamina. One boy, the younger of two children, reacted to the often-repeated, well-meant encouragement of his mother “Oh, you can do it if you want to” with the impression that his mother meant him to do anything, anytime, without preparation. When, later, he actually attempted a task, and found initial learning difficulties, he quickly became discouraged and disillusioned. He had believed wanting was enough for doing. How often parents fail to recognize that the child’s interpretations do not coincide with the meaning they intended — and then they become vexed with the child. I feel that I cannot express sufficiently the importance of the child’s reaction to the feeling behind the spoken word — whether hostility over optimism, or pessimism, disbelief, or lack of appreciation.

Recently, workers in allied fields, such as education, religion, and sociology, have emphasized the urgent need for worldwide maturity in the interest of preserving our civilization. It is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate the various views of maturity. We shall limit our consideration to individual maturity, from the standpoint of a dynamic theory of human motivation. Using such a theory as a basis for psychoanalytic therapy, we dispense first with a static concept of maturity as a finite goal attained at a specific period in a person’s lifetime. Maturity now assumes the position of an absolute goal, toward which an individual continually strives, in the course of maturing and self-development. This concept implies human capacities for continuous change and development, from birth to death. In the process of such development, a human being becomes increasingly conscious of his own inner resources, and steadily proceeds to strengthen and integrate them to the end of becoming a more really independent individual.")]),a("p",[e._v("At this point, the question may arise: Don’t we all, in the natural course of events, develop ourselves as we grow older? It is much too commonly believed that our intellectual and emotional maturing keeps pace with our physical growth and automatically increases with age. It is only under ideal conditions — which are rare in our culture — that this belief might be validated. Most of us are acquainted with some of the evidence belying this belief. Before considering some of this evidence, we shall describe the characteristics of a person who has been maturing in a healthy way. First, such a person has achieved a solid basis of inner unity. He is not thrown into a panic when he asks himself the question, “Who am I?” He is sure of his own identity. The opposite occurred in a boy of twenty-three, who had lost an awareness of his identity as a result of severe inner conflicts. This bewilderment about himself became apparent to him while reading the satire, “The Bear Who Wasn’t There.” This boy actually became terror-stricken. The story deals with a bear who wanders into a factory built over the cave where he had been hibernating. The factory personnel tried to persuade him that he is not a bear, but a man in a fur coat who is in need of the shade.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, how is a healthy person conscious of his own identity? To being with, he experiences his own inner aliveness of feeling and is aware that these feelings arise from within himself. He knows that he contributes to his own fear, his anger, and his joy, and realizes to some extent that he initiates these feelings — he acknowledges them to himself and others. He can admit, with inner conviction, “I feel affectionate; I am hostile; I am tired; I am dissatisfied; or I am pleased.” A young woman who was beginning to find her own center of gravity within herself, after a long period of dependency on others, described her first experience of spontaneous emotion for her fiancé in this way: I became aware of a warm feeling of affection arising from the pit of my stomach. I felt so alive. It occurred when Harry was not near me. Previously, only his presence near me could make me feel warm towards him.")]),a("p",[e._v("In the sphere of thinking, a strong individual is able to recognize and acknowledge the thoughts arising from within him. He can formulate and express them, and assume responsibility for them. He can say to himself, or to others, “I think this, I mean this, and these thoughts are mine, whether or not others think in a similar manner or different manner.” He uses his capacities for reason, judgment, and discrimination to evaluate the facts in a situation or the facts about a person. He draws his conclusion from the facts as they are, and does not distort them for his own satisfaction or for the satisfaction of others. He accepts responsibility for the consequences of his conclusions. He is able to accept criticism and uses it to change or improve his ideas. He also can evaluate the criticism offered to him. He knows his own value, he is aware of his beliefs, and accepts ownership for them. A healthy, mature person has also achieved a basic self-confidence as a result of being connected with his own feelings and thoughts. The basic confidence permits him to feel, think and act as a unit, and to be conscious of this unity.")]),a("p",[e._v("Since he is aware of his resources, and has been developing them, he can afford to test their limits and take the risk of making a mistake or even failing in a pursuit. He is capable of visualizing goals of his own choosing, which are commensurate with a true evaluation of his own resources. Since he does not impose unreasonable demands on himself in this matter, he can actively strive for the goal. He responds to successes and failures with a certain equanimity, and realizes his share in one or the other. He acknowledges openly, “I did this, I did it this way, these were my objectives, these are my mistakes.” In the event of failure, he has suffictient tolerance and respect for himself to learn from his mistakes and make renewed efforts toward his goals. He has an inner strength which he uses to separate the factors in a situation that can be attributed to the actual limitations inherent in it from the factors within himself which might be contributing to such limiations. For example, he does not expect himself to work well when he is fatigued, nor to overcome the limitations set by time, space, and difficulties with co-workers. He can work fairly comfortably within these limitations.")]),a("p",[e._v("A healthy person has a true evaluation of his resources, and his center of gravity lies within himself. Such an inner organization contributes immeasurably to satisfactory human relations. Since such an individual is on friendly terms with himself, he feels basically friendly toward people. He can show his friendliness and receive the friendship of others. He feels welcomed, and welcomes others, particularly since he decides when he wants to be with people and with whom he likes to be. He is also able to be with himself, and pursue his own interests. When the situation warrants, he can reject friendship and tolerate rejection by others. He can agree, disagree, and express antagonism or hostility if he sees fit. He can ask for, receive, and give help when the occasion demands. He is able to compete with others merely for the pleasure of testing his own resources. He is not unconsciously driven to compete, for the satisfaction of compulsive needs for success, revenge, admiration, or power. He can defend himself when attacked or insulted. He knows when decisions are necessary. Healthy self-development enables a person to recognize and tolerate the similarities and differences that exist between himself and others, without losing sight of his own individuality. This helps him respect the individuality of others. He can make honest comparisons which do not appreciably disturb his inner equilibrium. Such observations are used in the interest of his further self-development, rather than as a gauge of his relative superiority or inferiority.

For example, we tend to regard outer self-control as an indication that an individual is really in full control of himself. We praised those who display an unruffled calm and poise. Some of us are even likely to label a less-controlled person “infantile” or “childish” and tell him to act his age. Very often, this outer control is merely a thin, protective covering which defends the individual against awareness of deeper emotional conflict.")]),a("p",[e._v("There were many instances of breakdowns in the armed forces among men who were previously considered well-integrated in civilian life. On what basis were they considered well-integrated and mature? Well, these men were considered good providers for their families; rarely if ever did they disagree with anyone, at home or outside the home. They were loyal, conscientious, responsible employees, and worked actively in community organizations. Few people knew of their frequent episodes of insomnia, or their persistent need for patent remedies to relieve headaches and stomach distresses. We now know that these symptoms are, in many instances, the physical expressions of inner emotional turmoil, and the patent-remedy manufacturers have many customers in our society. It would be well for each of us to become more alert to these signs of internal emotional disturbances, and then search within ourselves for the ways in which we contribute to our own difficulties.")]),a("p",[e._v("Later, favorable influences contribute to greater independence, a healthy self-evaluation, and a genuine feeling of friendliness. He proceeds on a fairly straight course of constructive self-development into adolescence and adult life, on the foundation of his basic self-confidence. Tolstoy has said that the most important event in the life of a man is the moment when he becomes conscious of his own ego. Exactly at what age the first awareness of self occurs, we do not know. Some of us never have this happy experience. But in healthy self-development, it is probably realized in early age. I know of a four-year-old who was enough of an individual in her own right to tell a stranger visiting her home, “I like you. I can like you even if you do not like me.” How many of us can be so direct, assertive, and clear about our feelings?”")]),a("p",[e._v("In this abbreviated picture, it becomes apparent that there is little basis for characterizing behavior as “infantile” or “childish” when an adolescent or adult displays a relatively strong reliance on others for security which is appropriate for the individual in the earlier phases of self-development. However, excessive dependency on others for security is characteristic of impaired self-development, and they occur at any age. A child who is exposed to influences detrimental to healthy maturing carries his individual impairments into adolescence, and an adolescent whose inner psychic organization is shaky cannot be expected to develop, by magic, into a healthy adult merely by growing older. Nor do the additional responsibilities of adult life force a person to grow up. Becoming a healthy grown-up is a long-term process covering a period of years. Just growing older does not strengthen a person’s awareness of his inner resources.")]),a("p",[e._v("In view of these, I would like to point out cultural fallacy inherent in using chronological age as the main gauge of an individual’s preparedness for assuming responsibility. Is it valid to regard a person as criminally responsible because he is eighteen, or ready for marriage on the basis that he or she has lived eighteen, or twenty-one years? Does the twenty-first birthday make a person aware of his civic responsibility? Some of us may have heard youngsters in their teens admonished by their parents this way: “Act your age! You are old enough to know better! It is time you acted like a grown-up!” Note the use of the word act. It often becomes an act which is accepted for a fact.")]),a("p",[e._v("At the other end of the chronological scale, we find that some industries retire the person who has reached his sixty-fifth birthday on the assumption that he becomes too old to be useful — merely because of his age. We tend to ascribe enthusiasm, courage, flexibility to the young, and inertia, or rigidity to the older person. From analytic experience, we have ample evidence indicating that rigidity in a person’s responses is related to the strength of the neurotic defenses necessitated by basic anxiety, and these defenses can be as powerful in the very young as in those who are considered old. We can conclude, therefore, that chronological age is not a valid criterion for the adequacy of an individual’s capacity to understand the nature of responsibility. We need to establish better criteria for determining the extent to which a person is able to assume responsibility for himself and actions.")]),a("p",[e._v("To this point, we have sketched the maturing process under favorable influences. Analytic experience provides us the valuable data about the subsequent development of the individual whose earlier experiences were detrimental to healthy growing-up. In childhood, such a person would develop dependent on adults whose own self-development was impaired. As a result of their compulsive needs and unresolved conflicts, such adults were unable to appreciate the real need and factual weakness of the child. In various ways, they frustrated his attempts to develop his own resources. They may have expected too much of him or too little. They may have given him too much praised and encouragement, they may have ridiculed or disparaged the child’s efforts to earn and grow. Instead of allowing the child to develop his own resources, they imposed their decisions, views, feelings, and prejudices on him. As a result of these unfavorable influences — it would take too much space to elaborate on them — the child develops basic feelings of worthlessness and unacceptability. He also feels without resources in this environment, which is actually inimical to his real needs, and does not accord him the right to develop himself. These feelings are covered by the term “basic anxiety,” which also includes feelings of hostility toward the grown-ups on whom the child is dependent. The distorted picture of his own value and of the nature of others influences the course of his self-maturing in adolescence and adult life.")]),a("p",[e._v("To function as an individual among other individuals, a human being must achieve some semblance of inner unity. Just as the healthy child can integrate himself, on the base of solid self-confidence, so the child we have been describing above attempts to achieve a false sense of inner unity on a basis of anxiety. He has to use his resources in the interest of safety. Original, neurotic defenses against basic anxiety necessitate reinforcement and false illusions to further developing conflicts — both within himself and with his environment. The neurotic structure which is developed to protect the maturing individual against basic anxiety — that is, against experiencing it consciously — is enlarged during adolescence and adult life as his own needs expand and more demands are made on him. The ultimate result of this protective defensive structure are an increase in basic anxiety, greater distortion of an individual’s self-evaluation, and further impairment in human relations. In short, the very defenses needed in early life that retard impairment of self-development only serve further to weaken an individual’s strength as long as he continues to maintain his neurotic defenses in later life, when original unfavorable influences are no longer operating. Adverse influences may operate in the home, among friends, in school, or in other community relationships.")]),a("p",[e._v("On the other hand, healthy influences may assist the individual, at any age, to develop his inner resources toward better integration. Ameliorating factors are no doubt more effective during the earlier years, or at least, before the person has had the need and time to reinforce his neurotic defenses against anxiety. However, we have sufficient substantiating evidence from analytic experience for our belief that a person can begin to develop a healthy self at any age after dispensing with the destructive forces which he has been perpetuating. Naturally, the more time and need we have had to strengthen our neurotic defenses, the more work will be required to dispense with them. The outlook is brightened by the fact that many of us can and do function fairly realistically, and even successfully, in some areas, despite internal emotional disturbance. Few of us, indeed, have had the earlier ideal conditions which promote healthy self-development. As a result, most of us have, in the course of time, built up a strong protective structure to defend ourselves, both against ourselves and others. As we have said before, such a structure further impairs healthy maturing. Such impairment may vary in degree, and at times produce only minor inhibitions in functioning here or there. The greater the impairment in maturing, the more extensive is a subsequent paralysis in functioning, as seen in the severe neuroses and the psychoses. In the psychoses, the paralysis is decidedly marked.")]),a("p",[e._v("Now, what are the more common characteristics of an individual whose self-development has suffered as a result of neurotic involvement? The question “Who am I?” usually creates at least a mild confusion. Where the extent of impairment in function of the self is more severe, panic may be felt at the questioning of identity. One man recently told me that for one year, in his late teens, he went around feeling as if he were in a maze, absolutely unaware of his identity. What does this range of reactions indicate? First of all, inability to identify oneself implies alienation from an awareness of one’s feelings. A neurotic individual is unaware of an inner spontaneity of feelings. Of course he has feelings, but he does not experience them as stemming from within himself. He attributes them to others, or regards them as reactions to external experiences, pressure, and events. For example, the weather is responsible for his rise in spirits. The partner makes him angry. The recession in business has caused his depression. Insufficient sleep makes him irritable. Or some misdemeanor on a child’s part becomes the main cause of parental friction, irritation, and anger. So believes the individual who has no identity for himself. This estrangement from an awareness of one’s own feeling contributes to a person’s feeling of helplessness, and inability to assume responsibility for them, and excludes him from a sense of participation in living. The perpetuation of false illusions of conflict increases the alienation from himself and diminishes the capacity for enjoyment. A woman of forty, for example, insisted for many months in analysis that what her husband did and said was the main source of her anger at him. She could not see that she contributed in any way to the constant friction between them, or to her extreme vulnerability to his remarks and actions. Analysis revealed her irrational, compulsive needs to regard herself as a sacrificing goddess and to be treated in that manner.")]),a("p",[e._v("[Lecture ends abruptly here]")]),a("p",[e._v("[Were the account of this patient extended, it would probably show that through analysis, the patient was able to let go of some of the rigidity of her defenses against anxiety, that she was able partially to get back in touch with her feelings, to understand that her need to to see herself as a sacrificing goddess was self-reinforcing and enabled her to maintain this way of regarding herself — however, it was not only hostile toward her husband, it also sabotaged her enjoyment of being recognized for the real contributions that she was trying to make.")]),a("p",[e._v("Supposing that the lecture ended on this point, a closing passage might reiterate that no matter how adverse the earlier influences, and even at a fairly advanced agae after a long period of reinforcement of the neurotic defenses in operation, it is still possible, under most circumstances, for neurotic persons to get partially back in touch with the alive center of their own healthy, genuine feelings. One can partially reverse the progress of self-alienation and to regain one’s center of gravity, one’s sense of “This is who I am.” Here it would be appropriate to quote the paragraphs below, by Karen Horney. - AKS]")]),a("p",[e._v("« I feel that with regard to these difficulties experiences of the kind reported in the chapter on occasional self-analysis are encouraging. In several instances reported there the persons concerned had little if any experience with analytical treatment. To be sure, they did not go far enough in their endeavors at self-examination. But there seems no good reason not to believe that with a more widespread general knowledge of the nature of neurotic troubles and the ways of tackling them attempts of this kind can be carried further—always provided the severity of the neurosis is not prohibitive. The structure of personality is so much less rigid in milder neurotic entanglements than in severe ones that even attempts that are not carried very far may help considerably. In severe neuroses it is often necessary to do a great deal of analytical work before any liberating effect is achieved. In milder disturbances even a single uncovering of an unconscious conflict may be the turning point toward a freer development. But even if we grant that a considerable number of people can profitably analyze themselves, will they ever complete the work? Will there not always be problems left that are not solved or not even touched upon? My answer is that there is no such thing as a complete analysis. And this answer is not given in a spirit of resignation.

Thus, before the child even knows who he is and that he has a sex, the whole matter seems, quite literally, to have been taken out of his hands. He is obliged to content with the personal biases and idiosyncrasies of his parents, brothers and sisters, relatives, a family history, its social and economic status, the locality in which he lives, the type of government then existing, and the historical approach during which he made his appearance. Before proceeding, it is essential that we come to a mutual understanding regarding certain terms. By “genital,” I mean the actual genitalia — the penis and the vagina. By “sexual,” I mean something broader. The term includes any thought, action, or feeling in which the genital apparatus is a part, whether alone or with another person; and, any other thought, action, or feeling involving the secondary, non-genital, sexual anatomical characteristics. Such characteristics include, on the part of the male, hair on the face and body, the absence of developed breasts, the absence of menstruation and the capacity of giving birth to and nursing children.")]),a("p",[e._v("It is easier to define anatomical differences, as well as the acts in which they manifest themselves, than it is to answer the question of their probable or possible influence in determining the separate characters of men and women as we perceive them. For cultural influences are so pervasive and invasive that we cannot assert with any degree of assurance precisely where they end and where the significance of anatomical differences can be clearly established. Our problem, then, is how to examine individuals, male and female, and how to determine what effect their special anatomical differences may have. These interacting, interrelating, and integrating forces can be understood only in terms of interpersonal relationships. Thus, the attitudes that an individual develops for purposes of security, safety, health, and as part of his neurosis, we refer to as his “total character structure.” Our specific interest is in real and apparent masculinity and femininity. The more we clarify and dissipate what is merely apparent, the closer we shall come to knowing what is real. Consequently, we should ascertain how, and at what points cultural influences act upon the individual, and to which he or she reacts in the development of the so-called “masculine” and “feminine” attitudes. As a result of these interactions, each one develops his or her notion of how a boy or girl is supposed to act, think, and feel.")]),a("p",[e._v("How are our concepts of masculinity and femininity developed? Because, in our society, child-rearing is carried on almost solely by the mother, the feelings, words, and actions associated with love and affection have become closely identified with women in general. Thus, the adjectives “maternal,” “sisterly,” “feminine,” “womanly,” “girlish” have become associated with love, sympathy, understanding, warmth, affection, nourishment, growth, development. In fact, these connotative values have been pushed to such extremes that woman is regarded by some not only as the sacred fountainhead and dispenser of all feelings, but is invested with that rare capacity called “feminine intuition.” This lead to such ridiculous clichés as “Mother knows best” and “Who should know more about my child than I, his mother?”")]),a("p",[e._v("We may as well admit, at the outset, and at this point, that it is still another question as to who really does know. Since the mother is the main source of giving pleasure and allaying discomfort, the growing child adopts the belief that women are the loving and the comforting ones. Love is theirs to give and to receive, to withhold and to refuse. This view, of course, is double-edged, because, as a result of it, women become not only the greatest source of love, but also the deepest source of pain, through their refusal to love, or to be loved.

And so the myth of woman — the enigma, the mysterious — is created. Because of her function in bowel and bladder training, the mother becomes associated with another, quite different set of attitudes. Through various appropriate and not-so-appropriate gestures, she indicates approval or disapproval regarding soiling and wetting. Her negative reactions result in the development of prudishness and the abhorrence of any mention of physiological functions. In this manner, the foundations are laid for what are referred to as “feminine” attitudes towards sex, since the child cannot differentiate the subtle differences in function of everything “down there” — in the region referred to as his private parts” — all these confusing attitudes become associated with sexuality. Being longer under his mother’s influence, the girl continues with these feminine attitudes and has them reinforced at the onset of menses.

Either she is told that she is too young to know about such things, except insofar as they apply to the bees, the birds, and the flowers, or else she is given a purely hygienic account — which, by its utter lack of warmth and real understanding, fails to prepare her for her future roles as wife and mother. In fact, all of her training has been concentrated upon superficial matters. She has been taught how to conduct herself in the correct manner with her first date; in how she must proceed in the romantic game of courtship and marriage. However, she has been taught very little concerning our function as a real human being in the ultimate relationship of marriage.

Somewhere in his second or third year, a boy becomes aware that he is anatomically from his sister and his mother, and like his father. He notices that his mother reacts differently to him than to his sister. His mother may not realize it, but already she is taking pride in him as her son, even while resenting the fact that he will find life easier in this man’s world. And although he soon will be imbued with the notion of his own uniqueness, specialness, and difference, at the same time, he will become rather painfully aware of his being increasingly removed, detached, and excluded from certain intimacies with his mother which are permitted his sister for a longer period. By the time his father’s influence has become a dominant factor in his life, the little boy has already unconsciously accepted many of the attitudes regarded as feminine. These, naturally, concern all the implications and manifestations of love, and feelings in general, as well as the functions of urination, defecation, and sexuality.

Defecating and urinating openly before each other is encouraged, as well as competitive games involving who can spit and urinate further. Mutual examination and comparison of genitals further breaks down many of the feminine taboos regarding sexuality.

For his training should have respect, and should have stressed not what kind of a boy he was, but what kind of a person he might develop into.

Included in this attempt at self-indication would be sexual exploits, carried out with the stringent exclusion of anything soft, tender, and romantic. But there is a second type of solution: the more a boy may become less masculine — that is, he sheds, more and more, the so-called masculine traits in favor of a kind of sexual neutrality. He has become a “neuter,” from the point of view of what society expects of him. If you met him, you would have great difficulty in deciding whether he were masculine or feminine in his feelings, thoughts, and actions. A third type of solution will involve renunciation of all, or most, of his masculine traits, in favor of being feminine.

We will understand all of this much better when we see it evolving in the following family situation: at first glance, this family would appear to be a happy one, like so many others. However, on careful scrutiny, we can see much more that lies beneath the surface. The mother was exaggeratedly feminine in some ways, yet almost masculine in others. Indeed, she gave the impression of being a loving mother and a real woman in civic interests. Her façade was that of a gracious and idealistic person. But behind the façade were secretiveness, evasiveness, and sadism. Considering this a man’s world, where women were invariably downtrodden, she was a vigorous feminist, and considered herself a very spiritual person. She exploited a compliant manner merely to lead one on and sabotage one’s best efforts.

She was considered a perfect child by her mother, and was heartily approved of by her two maiden aunts, and had won a somewhat reserved affection from her father and brother. She was cute, charming, and coy. In addition to having a knack for saying pert and clever things, she employed evasiveness and cunning tricks to win her mother’s support against her brother, who was considered a “bad” boy. Indeed, it always happened that when she was innocently attending to her affairs, the bad boy would start to hit her. She would come, screaming, to her mother and aunts, who would placate her, and punish her brother. And, to make matters worse for him, little sister would then approach him in a spirit of generous forgiveness. In the course of her mother’s psychoanalysis, significant changes took place in the girl. Her mother realized that unwittingly, she had encouraged her daughter in the role that she herself had assumed. Once the mother had seen through her own sweetness and light attitudes as well as her dishonesties, she became aware of how she had encouraged the very same attitudes in her little girl. As the mother became more direct, honest, and healthily assertive, she began to deplore many of the qualities in her child, which heretofore had appeared so charmingly feminine. Consequently, in the course of two years, the girl herself developed into a more direct, open, and forthright person. Having seen through her own techniques of needling her husband until he flew into a rage, she began to see how her daughter had used identical tactics with her brother until he reached the state of helpless fury. Once the little girl sensed that this role was no longer valuable, she gave it up, and began to regard her mother as the dominant female personage in the household. The following conversation took place between daughter and mother some two years after the mother’s analysis had begun. The heretofore sweet and charming child had begun exhibiting her latent temper, which apparently was being stimulated, now, by the need to fight for what she wanted. Moreover, she had learned that having a temper was permissible. In fact, by this time, the entire family were expressing themselves more freely, except the maiden aunts, whose importance in the household had diminished considerably, and were having a bewildering time of it, as these apparently cataclysmic changes were taking place. Janie, the little girl, had become angry at her mother, and looking up at her with a winning smile on her face, said, “I could gouge your eyes out, pull out all your hair, and kick you in the stomach!” The following day, she had a slight cold and was kept in bed. One of her maiden aunts came in to play with her. After about an hour, Janie said to her aunt, “I’m tired. I want you to go” — to which the aunt replied, “I just want to finish threading this needle.” Janie insisted petulantly, “But I’m tired of you. I want to be alone!” And, when the shocked aunt retorted, “How will you feel, Janie, if I tell your mother?” — the little girl replied briskly, “I’ll tell her myself!”")]),a("p",[e._v("What changes took place in the little boy? He had received the full brunt of the worst period of his parents’ married life, and in addition, was the first child. The mother had succeeded in emasculating him, in seducing him for herself, and away from his father. She had also succeeded in making him terrified of his father. In pursuing his exaggerated masculine role, the father had unwittingly supported his wife’s seductive manipulations with the boy. When his mother’s psychoanalysis began, the picture I got of the little boy was that of a weak, scrawny boy who was given to petulant outbursts. Extremely tense and sensitive, shy, and withdrawn, he preferred playing with his younger sister, or girls of his own age, refusing to have anything to do with boys. He constantly clung to his mother, and found all kinds of pretexts for touching her, exploring her body, asking intimate questions about sexual differences and about babies. He cried very easily, dawdled in his play and his eating, and suffered from disturbed sleep. The two years of his mother’s analysis wrought a change in this little boy.

Two years later, both children looked like upstanding, direct little people, with more firmness and conviction in their faces — although the little girl still appeared to be mentally the healthier of the two. The following overt changes had taken place in the boy: he now preferred playing with boys, and the more rough-and-tumble, the more he sought them. He took many beatings from these boys, but kept coming back for more. He talked more, and had assumed the gruff, “Hail, fellow-met-well” language of boys. Much less fearful of his father, he would openly and aggressively attack him, in words and while tussling. Although his newly-begotten assertiveness was quite aggressive, violent, and often misdirected, he was feeling his oats. On occasion, he even differed quite openly with his mother — which previously he would not have dared to do.

When an individual begins psychoanalysis, he may not even be aware of what role — with reference to masculinity or femininity — he has adopted. Indeed, it usually takes some time before he realizes that he has adopted a role — generally, the exaggeratedly masculine or feminine individual — may feel that he is being spontaneously and naturally masculine or feminine. This would be especially true in those extreme instances where the individual has been completely submerged in the part he is playing. Such people come for psychoanalysis because of the failure of this role to give them a feeling of inner harmony or satisfaction. Nevertheless, their complaints rarely touch upon the real problem: namely, their exaggerated maleness or femaleness. This is equally true in the case of homosexuals.

Many people get along, and even more live quite satisfactory lives in any of these roles — for it is not the role itself that is important for us, but how it came into being; how it was necessitated by life’s experiences; and what penalties and privations it exacts from us. Consequently, where life has severely, and at an early age, profoundly hurt the individual, a life of constant turmoil and pain is almost inevitable. Some patients come to analysis with the complain that “this married existence, neuter arrangement, or homosexual relationship is not satisfactory to me.” What happens in all analyses, from whatever phase of pseudo-sexuality one may start, is that the patient becomes aware that none of these solutions was or can be satisfactory. He begins to see the necessity for a clear understanding of his neurotic character structure and how it has been maintaining its pseudo-sexual attitude.

He conceives of man as a helpless, fore-doomed, and wretched being, driven by powerful instincts which he cannot control. The most that man can hope for, according to Freud, is a socially acceptable adjustment to a situation which is necessarily bad, without it crippling him too much in the process. A further proof of the influence of the culture in which Freud lived was evidenced by his attitude towards women. Reflecting the Victorian thesis that men were generally superior to women, his psychology was predominantly male. He regarded women as something less than men — individuals who were incomplete men, inherently inferior to men, and hence utterly incapable of scaling the physical and spiritual heights of the male domain.

In contrast to Freud’s generally pessimistic view — that mankind is the fore-doomed victim of destructive drives which he cannot control — our present, basic ideas are positive, optimistic, and essentially hopeful. Modern psychoanalysis operates on the conviction that the human being can reason, act, and feel; that he knows what he wants, and can do something about realizing his goals. We believe, further, that the individual has the capacity to grow, develop, and be creative; that he wants to, and can enjoy work and love relationships; that he is basically constructive, and that his destructive drives are only secondary results of his fears, activated by the restriction and frustration of his natural, spontaneous creativeness.")]),a("p",[e._v("Against this background, we can now proceed to investigate some aspects of the role of sex in human affairs.

It is something of an anomaly in our society that the natural curiosity of children is applauded in all directions, except with regard to biological facts. A child is aware of its body before it has any real appreciation of self. It is normal and natural for it, therefore, to explore all the bodily orifices, and to stimulate any part of its body for pleasure.

A widespread prejudice against sexual activity during menstruation still exists, with the concomitant belief that it is unhygienic — though this is definitely untrue. Participation in sexuality during menses is a concern of the persons involved, and is a matter of their own individual preferences.

The satisfactory achievement of this mutual cooperation is difficult to obtain in our culture, because a feeling that the enjoyment of sex is sinful is still so deeply ingrained in many allegedly emancipated members of our society.")]),a("p",[e._v("In society, likewise, the acceptance of a double standard, for men and not women, is culturally determined. A man is supposed to “sow his wild oats,” and free marital relationships. This attitude, however, is rapidly changing with the increase of career women. Sexual freedom for women has been further aided by the dissemination of sex hygiene information in the younger age groups, and through the greater availability of contraceptive aids, which has lowered the frequency of venereal diseases and illegal operations. The need for extra-marital relationships is not an expression of the lack of sexual satisfaction with a partner, but rather, an evidence of a deeper disturbance in the whole interpersonal relationship manifesting itself in a disturbance of the sex-act. Thus, a husband or wife may rationalize their right to indulge in extra-marital affairs because their marital partner is sexually unresonposive. Upon closer examination, it often develops that the whole fabric of their relationship is emotionally warped and devoid of pleasure.")]),a("p",[e._v("Any discussion of extra-marital relationships usually turns, sooner or later, to the topic of frigidity in women. Here we have a classic example of putting the cart before the horse. Our cultural attitudes specifically force frigidity in women, and then insist that women are more difficult to arouse sexually than men. This is a biological fallacy. Well-adjusted women are just as eager for sexual activity as are well-adjusted men. They are aroused just as easily and obtain equally as much pleasure from the sexual act. There are, of course, degrees of pleasure in sex, as well as in all other human activities. Normally, pleasure is obtained from all aspects of sexual activity and, depending upon mutual consent, may be of limited extent, or continue on to complete orgasm.")]),a("p",[e._v("The romanticized version of sex is a state in which the individual is carried away, and there is a loss of self. This is something literally “out of this world” — the nth degree of ecstatic bliss. Actually, of course, it is really nothing of the kind. What we have here is the use of sex as a neurotic escape mechanism. Much as may be observed in inidividuals who use hypnotics, alcohol, and drugs for the same purpose. Factually, a natural orgasm is a heightened state of sexual pleasure with conscious awareness, as a cumulation of heterosexual activity by two mutually cooperative individuals. The romanticized notion of loss of self therefore actually prevents the individuals from full, conscious enjoyment of a highly pleasurable act. Unfortunately, in our culture, sex and love are synonymous terms. Sex does not equal love, nor does love equal sex. Love can be defined as a state of pleasurable mutuality which, when present between two persons of the opposite sex, may have as one of its aspects, pleasurable sexual activity.")]),a("p",[e._v("From what has been noted previously, it is not surprising that there are cultural determinants for the use of the words “man” and “woman.” We use the word “man” in an anatomic sense, as a qualifying adjective, and as an all-inclusive symbol to denote the human race. The word “woman,” on the other hand, while it has anatomic, and qualitative meanings, is never used in our culture to denote the human race. It might be argued that “man” is merely a generic term — a habit of speech — which is convenient to continue to use, and which has long since lost its essentially masculine connotation. But how, then, explain that the qualities “masculine” and “feminine” also have fallacious connotations in our culture? “Womanly,” for example, or “feminine,” are synonymous with softness and warmth, while “manly” and “masculine” denote strength and virility. These categorical attributes are merely projections, however, of our cultural attitudes. They are not biological characteristics of men or women. They are, rather, accepted and culturally predetermined characteristics of what we believe to be the difference between the sexes. Actually, the qualities of warmth and strength are innate in all human beings.")]),a("p",[e._v("In an attempt to sustain the contention that women are basically different from men, or vice-versa. The point is frequently made that, after all, only women can bear children. But, for that matter, only men can impregnate women. Then again, the position is often taken that women can have many children from one man, or many men, with the implication that this makes them radically different from men. But those who argue that point frequently fail to mention the fact that one man can be the father to many children — by one woman, or many women.")]),a("p",[e._v("This is merely my way of illustrating that the use of an anatomical argument to prove a psychological point is both an evidence of unclear thinking and an attempt to avoid the real issue. What we are interested in is not the sexual, anatomical differences per se, but the psychological attitudes toward those sexual, anatomical differences — as determined by our particular cultural pattern. Men who are emotionally insecure often attempt to obtain a feeling of security by assuming a dominating position toward women. In the last few years, social changes have been so rapid that these men feel threatened by the increasing emancipation and freedom which women have obtained. Such men feel that the way things are going, the time is not far off when women will become uncontrollable and completely out of hand. Yet, at the same time, these men — who assume the role of the benevolent, stronger male, caring for the helpless and weaker-minded female — complain bitterly, but secretly enjoy the fact that women are “different,” and not endowed with a sense of justice, camaraderie, stability, and clear-headedness — which they feel are peculiar to men. The point that this type of man overlooks is that a woman functioning as a person in a real, cooperative interpersonal relationship would not be such a problem to him, and would not have to exact, or have thrust upon her, the alleged special privileges, prerogatives, and deferences shown to her in our culture. Although it may appear that men are mainly responsible for this situation, actually, women, unconsciously — and often consciously — nurture and invite just those atittudes. They feel that they are gaining by these special privileges — but at the same time, contradictorily, want to be treated just like men. Clearly, they would be better off without these special prerogatives, or being treated “just like men,” and if they devoted their energies to becoming their own selves.")]),a("p",[e._v("Our social attitudes toward sex have also created an extensive, vulgar male vocabulary in which sexual activity is referred to violent and humiliating terms. This is a direct reflection of our deeply-ingrained conception of sex as a violent and humiliating assault on a woman by a man in which she is harmed, and is the unwilling partner. As a result, many men and women have to re-create this neurotic setting before they can obtain “sexual satisfaction.” Usually, however, women do not express themselves sexually in vulgar terms. In accordance with the rules of the game — of the romantic game — all references to the sexual act must be indirect. A man may be referred to as having a “nice physique” and being “clean-limbed.” But any direct reference to the male genital region is strictly taboo. Sex can be used for the same neurotic purpose by both men and women. And what holds true for sex holds for any thought, feeling, or act which is shared by two individuals. What concerns us, primarily, is the meaning — that thought, feeling, or act — may have for the individual in relationship to himself, and to those with whom he lives. In modern psychoanalysis, it is the individual and his interpersonal relationships which form the basis of our thinking — not his sexual activity or its numerous derivatives and involvements.")]),a("p",[e._v("Instead of the sexual act being indulged in for pleasure, it is more often used for the purposes of humiliation, hostility, and disparagement, as well as of power and prestige. Men frequently use it to gain approval; to inflate their sense of importance, and to bolster their self-doubted potency. Many women use sex as a lure, to ensnare their men, as well as to obtain gifts and admiration as an object of sexual desire.

Modern psychoanalytic research has revealed that a basic cause of the difficulty these organically sound men have often lies in their hostile attitude towards women. They do not want to give women any sexual satisfaction, and ejaculate prematurely out of unconscious spite. It is a form of protection — a means of preventing them from coming close to a woman for fear that she might sense their hostility and retaliate in kind. In a broader sense, premature ejaculation may also be a symptom of a generaly anti-social attitude. Some men are afraid of any close human contact, because it might prove a threat to their false notions of independence and misogynistic self-sufficiency. Frigidity in women may also have a similar connotation, or it may be that they must deny having any pleasure. Admission of such pleasure might mean, to them, the existence of an obligation which they cannot or do not want to repay.")]),a("p",[e._v("The excessive emphasis on sex in our culture is manifested in our dream-language, and has been subjected to a mistaken and one-sided interpretation from the Freudian viewpoint. Many dreams which seem to be purely sexual in nature are actually only superficially concerned with sex. Modern psychoanalysis has revealed many significant social attitudes in the character of the dreamer which have little to do with sex per se. For example, a young man dreams that he lies on a couch. He has a long penis which reaches from himself to a woman who stands some distance off. At first glance, this dream seems to be concerned with the problem of potency. The patient’s history reveals that it has quite a different meaning. Factually, he has no sexual problem. All his life, this man insisted on lying back while women were at his beck and call, assuming all responsibility, and were the active partners in the relationship. In other words, women were relegated to a safe distance, near enough to be enjoyed, in carefree comfort, but sufficiently far away to make it impossible for them to affect him personally or to encroach on his privacy.

She played one against the other for what she could get out of them, and so prevented either from coming too close to her and making demands. The disturbance in her sexual relationship, as expressed in her dream, was merely a manifestation of her disturbed interpersonal relationships in general. Actually, this woman was not only frigid, but felt nauseated at the idea of a man kissing her. She never had any sexual experience, or anything remotely approximating it.")]),a("p",[e._v("A third dream is fairly common, in one of its many variations. It is of a man or a woman who dreams that he or she is having sexual intercourse or defecating in some extremely public place. This dream usually reveals an attitude of unconscious arrogance, and has little in it of sexual significance. It manifests the dreamer’s defiance toward what people think of him, to such an extent that he does not care who sees his sexual activity, defecation, or urination. The sexual content of the dream is, hence, far less important than the general attitude of contemptuous indifference to society and its conventions. It is fairly common for a woman psychoanalytic patient to “fall in love” with her analyst. She may overtly or covertly suggest a relationship, and she may even believe that her desires are quite sincere and legitimate. Yet, on examination, we commonly find that the proposed liaison has ulterior motives. The patient either feels that she could dominate the situation, if she could make the analyst respond to her advances, or else it might be a means of breaking off the analytic relationship, or a desire to compromise the analyst professionally. If this could be accomplished, everything unpleasant or unacceptable which the analyst had said could, she feels, be invalidated on the grounds of a lack of professional dignity or ability. Again, such a patient might be using sex to get so close to the analyst that he would not be able to see her clearly.

It has also been seen that, with greater social tolerance and acceptance of homosexuals in society, it has become more feasible for same-sex couples to cultivate healthy, mutually nurturing relationships and to raise children in such home environments. While social disapproval remains common and often impairs the health of such relations and child-rearing activities, it has also become evident in social-scientific research that the incidence of healthy and neurotic patterns in children does not issue from the sexual orientation of the parents. The full spectrum of healthy and neurotic patterns can be seen in all sex partners, irrespective of their particular sexual orientations.

We shall be more especially concerned with neurotic, or irrational pessimism. We do not speak of normal pessimism. The words seem almost a contradiction in terms, and the word “normal” is unsatisfactorily vague. Irrational pessimism will have the characteristics of any neurotic drive, and will show, in addition, those peculiar to itself. It is pervasive and indiscriminate; comparatively unrelated to reality; compulsively governed by unrealistic drives and illusions, hence to consume the whole personality; is exaggerated and dramatized; is basically destructive; and is unrelated to time, place, and situation. The basic feeling is that everything was, is, and will be bad. It is motivated and impelled by forces of considerable intensity. There are several factors to explain this: The trend may be difficult to identify, most of its determinants, operations, and powerful motivations may be unconsious. Rational pessimism has quite a different character. It is limited and is caused by actual difficulty. It is felt only by those aspects of the personality currently involved — except in those rare instances which really are life-and-death matters. It is in proportion to whatever caused it; consequently, the situation, however bad it may be, can be viewed objectively and constructively by the rest of the self.

Efforts made to overcome real difficulty tend to strengthen and re-vivify the person making them, lead to increased self-esteem, courage, and joy; and act as a positive stimulus to others.

He is often only partly aware of them, no matter how much they may influence his life and the lives of those about him. They may show only under special circumstances; they may show, to some extent, all the time, but the more intense and more exclusive in response to existing situations.

Rational pessimism may be the response to repeated failure in attaining a goal. When the reaction is one of morbid pessimism, another factor must be added: the irrational expectations connected with reaching the goal. Such expectations are fore-doomed to defeat. And it is this type of failure from which neurotic pessimism derives. This point will be clearer when we trace the formation of these irrational expectations. There are, of course, individual differences present at birth, but for any infant, most of his organism is used to further living and growth, except for those few born severely maimed physically or mentally.")]),a("p",[e._v("The basis for neurotic pessimism must thus be found in life experience. The child’s attempts to learn judgment, decision, responsibility, choice, discrimination, and individual resourcefulness in his attempts need encouragement in order to succeed.

The disastrous effects will vary, of course, according to the number, intensity, and spirit of the frustrations. Simple, direct wishes become distorted during such a process, and rarely reach consciousness. In their stead is a feeling of defeat. Even this may be buried beneath a series of defenses erected to protect the individual against it, and also against the occurrence of failure. When these changes have taken place, the natural situation is reversed. The maximum of energies is deflected from constructive goals, to pessimistic, destructive ones.")]),a("p",[e._v("Even an infant can react to difficulty with anger and temper, or he may react by clinging, or by an attempt at withdrawal, often revealed by the constant sleeping and apathy — even to the point of wasting in death. The last reaction is the most dangerous of the three. It is especially threatening in infancy, when the baby requires the active mobilization of its forces to maintain life. The situation becomes more complex when walking, talking, thought, and feeling are added to the picture. The child’s natural sense of his own smallness can be exaggerated by frustration or a loss of love, until he feels overwhelmed by helplessness. As a result, his own character may be constructed out of the three attitudes of aggressiveness, yielding, and detachment.")]),a("p",[e._v("The situation may even culminate in producing a fourth attitude: a trend towards self-destruction. In infancy, self-destruction is merely a more or less accidental result of withdrawal, but later it can represent a definite direction or goal. The child’s security depends on love, and loss of love means pain. When he experiences it, his attention becomes redirected to the avoidance of pain. Failing to be acceptable to his parents, he aims to be completely acceptable to himself. To meet this need, he forms in his mind an idealized image of himself. This image also serves the function of giving him a false sense of unity and wholeness, which he needs acutely, as his personality is now made up of contradictory drives, and the disequilibrium thus produced further increases his helplessness. The idealized image may be patterned after the predominating trend in his character, or may be a fusion of two or more trends — a fusion which minimizes contradictions or puts them in a flattering light.

Self-destruction as a consuming ideal cannot be a primary goal. It is rather a consequence of a failure to live up to the idealized image. We can see, now, what was meant by irrational expectations: the expectation of meeting the standards set by the idealized image. In attempts to reach this goal, failure may be felt as simple frustration, but actually, it is fore-doomed. The whole self is rarely consumed in the service of the idealized image — something of genuine feeling, thought, and desire remains. But apart from these remnants of a real self, the individual tends to regard himself from the point of view of this image — to accept anything in himself that seems to fit the image, and to reject whatever does not.

Its extent and intensity, and the prominence of its appearance in any individual will depend on the degree of preoccupation with with the idealized image, and how strongly the individual feels its demands, and how he feels he may be able to meet these demands. Pessimism will become acutely manifest whenever the individual’s attempts in this direction are seriously threatened — whether by life situations, or during the course of a psychoanalysis. There are several component trends to irrational pessimism: they tend to fall into groups commonly present at one time.

In this situation, a state of chronic dissatisfaction may be needed to whip the individual to renewed efforts. There is also present the failure to obtain real satisfaction from real success. Enjoyment is felt as dangerous, as something out of control in the open. So great are the destructive trends associated with pessimism that a lack of control is often visualized as an orgy of wanton destructiveness. Enjoyment also threatens detachment and entails responsibility.

The “good ol’ days” are seen in roseate hues, even though they were really not so happy. The past seems carefree, and there is a morbid turning away from from the present, and even more so from the future. The attitude is related to the extreme need for freedom — a freedom of a special kind. It means an absence of all ties, and a release from anything which might interfere with a person’s functioning according to his idealized image. It is a living in a vacuum, which seems the ideal reality. A person may show this nostalgia in a preoccupation with his childhood. He may be haunted by sad tunes of long ago; he remembers the scenes of his childhood as beautiful. The past presents, and represents, to him, a respite from struggle, a realm without problems. In one patient, the preoccupation with the past had, also, another meaning, and one quite different from a seeing the past in such a roseate hue.

These people feel that their relationships are without life. They feel limited, rigid, and controlled. They suffer from boredom and a conviction that nothing changes. Their idealized image imposes upon them the need to function automatically, like a machine. And though such functioning is extremely rigid and restricted, it represents their peculiar concept of freedom: freedom from spontaneous feeling, which might be beyond their control. During analysis, one patient began to recognize how inhibiting her stoical idea of an absence of feeling was. The insight disturbed her, as it made her aware of her emptiness, and exposed the invalidity of her idealized image. Much work must be done when the feeling of deadness is strong before patients are willing to take a chance on themselves, and on living. They use the feeling as a barrier against the pain of exposure, against insights into measures taken to attain irrational goals, and to prevent the coming to life of those parts of the personality which violate the idealized image.

It has its advantage, and its disadvantage, both strongly felt. The person feels as though in a vacuum, surrounded by a wall of protective space, felt as distance, a haze, or a glass enclosure. The advantage is protection. Such a person feels unassailable and invulnerable to mental or physical pain — beyond material needs and invisible. He may feel that he can see out, observe others, know their secrets; but on the other hand, he suffers from being alone, in an endless void, shut off, unable to make himself felt or heard. As children and even as adults, such people often have the fantasy of being invisible — able to float through space, doors, and walls. Or the fantasy may be more aggressive, and they may have the idea of spiriting people away. Intense suffering is felt by that part of the personality submerged in the service of the idealized image. It makes frantic, but futile attempts to break out of the void. Such attempts are short-lived, because of the inexorable demands of the idealized image. These genuine efforts are not the same as the majestic sorties of the image coming down to earth. One patient behaved like a queen who, in transitory earthly visitations, picked up and dropped a series of Princes Charming. Everything, indeed, was picked up and dropped in this manner.

They sit and do nothing, like some Oriental god, immortal, unassailable, beyond material wants. There may be another disregard for the body and for feelings. The problem of asceticism is obviously involved in these attitudes. An actual wallowing in despair and apathy may occur and may contain unmistakable destructiveness, or be felt merely as respite from turmoil.

In connection with the turning to the past, we find a great dislike for taking any chance on the future, and aversion for the unknown, and a need to be protected against it. People with pessimistic trends cannot understand how anyone can enjoy taking a stand, taking a chance, or think of enjoying the privileges of responsibility. They try to foresee and plan the future, to know everything in advance.")]),a("p",[e._v("The negative therapeutic reaction and creativity: In any psychoanalysis, the therapist has to expect periods when some piece of insight, instead of giving greater freedom, will seem to make the person worse. For the moment, all symptoms will seem to be exaggerated. We name this the “negative therapeutic reaction.” It is most likely to occur when basic problems are reached, threatening the idealized image, or exposing basic conflicts. It can be quite disturbing, and at times, is one of the factors making caution and slowness necessary. In dealing with neurotic pessimism, this reaction may appear whenever insight is imminent, or the need to make efforts is clear. Trends already discussed show, then, in distinct outline, and two yet to be discussed, destructiveness and vindictiveness, are always present. A hatred of growth and creativeness is apt to show with special vividness. Pessimistic people may be capable of short bursts of creative effort. They want to have the thing done quickly ended and out of the way. What they envisage is a finished product which has ceased to develop. A growing thing is dynamic, out of control — and that is deeply disturbing to people who are compelled to to arrange all thought, feeling, and action in rigid conformity with the idealized image. To gain back control, they rush to snuff out anything forming between themselves and others — birth, life, creativeness, and the right of other people to be different are all hateful to them.")]),a("p",[e._v("Concerning destructiveness: We have touched on some aspects of destructiveness in several connections, for it is prominent in the whole picture of neurotic pessimism. It is chronically present, and will be evoked in greater intensity by any threat to the status quo. People suffering from pessimistic trends feel hopeless about themselves and powerless to improve. On this basis they justify a positive allowing, wishing, and encouragement of their own destruction. They do not want to help themselves, and definitely do not want to help others. Such people may show a macabre sense of humor, but the things they laugh at are not funny. They laugh at injury, illness, death, and loss. They even seem most amused when such disasters happen to themselves, as though they enjoyed sitting in at their own death and dissolution. But one may discern a driven, frightened quality in their laughter. When the causes for it are revealed, it disappears and gives place to tears. Destruction also shows in attempts to humiliate, degrade, exploit, and frustrate others, and pessimistic people turn these same attitudes onto themselves, and will do whatever they can to prevent anyone from helping them effectively.")]),a("p",[e._v("Vindictiveness and Vindicativeness: The vindictiveness of these people may be generated in a number of ways, and in as many ways justified. Though they bend all energies towards reaching the goal of the idealized image, yet at the same time they behave as though they had already reached it, and many devices are used to maintain this illusion. Such a very false and contradictory position naturally leaves them open to exposure, and extremely sensitive to anything that threatens exposure. When they are exposed, or if they imagine that danger is imminent, they may resort to a direct assault in retaliation. This may also be expected if any of the questionable traits which they have developed are exposed. Because these people feel so keen an intolerance of responsibility and/or failure, the one who exposes them is always the one at fault in their eyes. Their very deep self-hatred is often directed outward. If they are made aware of their lack of courage, or their negative traits, they become disturbed, vindictive, and hateful, and all the more so because they feel that such traits will prevent them from reaching their irrational goals.")]),a("p",[e._v("Vindictiveness and vindicativeness are closely associated in these cases. The only thing that vindicates them in their own eyes is attaining the idealized image. That, however, justifies anything. If they can believe in that image as something already reached, they feel cleared past question. It is on the basis of such a belief that many of the most excessive demands are made, in the most fantastic pseudo-logical rationalizations erected. There is a feeling that their wonderfulness should not require evidence, but be accepted as a proven reality, and they expect to be lavishly nurtured for their remarkable qualities. Promises they consider enough, and no fulfillment should be required. A promise gives them the sense of something already accomplished, a bit of accomplished largesse. These exaggerated and inflated notions of the self differ from the conscious delusions of the psychotic — namely, of the insane — in that these exaggerated and inflated notions of self are unconscious.

Two people enter a relationship happily and hopefully, but after a while find themselves disappointed and also disillusioned. When that happens, it is almost always the other fellow who is blamed. In my consultations with married couples, I find for example that a wife will complain of her husband’s staying out late and neglecting her, or perhaps for some other grievance.

The word “sadistic” will call forth associations with sexual perversions — conditions in which people find sexual satisfaction only when the partner is tied, beaten, or otherwise mistreated. While such tendencies form an interesting aspect of the general problem of sadism, it is not this aspect that we will stress, and this is for two reasons: first of all, perversions are comparatively rare occurrences; and secondly, they are only one among many more important manifestations of the sadistic character. We shall speak, instead, of the sadistic character in totality, and also, in particular, of its tendency to find conscious and unconscious gratification or thrill in criticizing, in degrading, in humiliating, and in enslaving or exploiting the partner. The sadistic person may be driven by a compulsive desire and need to enslave others, especially a love partner. In consequence, his victim will be reduced to the status of a superman’s slave — deprived not only of any independent wishes and feelings, but of making any claims whatsoever upon the superman.")]),a("p",[e._v("Sometimes, this compulsive drive expresses itself in the impulse to mold or educate the victim. In its most benign state, it may have some constructive aspects, as in the case of parents who mold children, or teachers who mold pupils. More frequently, however, this desire to shape and mold another’s personality is activated by purely selfish motives. These motives stem from a deep-seated neurosis which has existed from childhood, and which has been enlarged upon during adolescence and during early adulthood.")]),a("p",[e._v("The master-slave aspect is occasionally evident in sexual relations and, as mentioned earlier, many perversions are practiced either actively or imagined, at these times. The function of the perversions is to maintain the false, inhuman relationship by degrading and humiliating the thought-to-be inferior partner. This same general idea might hold true in homosexual relationships involving a younger and an older man. Frequently though not invariably, the sadistic partner in a sexual relationship is haunted by a possessive jealousy, and exercises this jealousy in order to inflict torture. Such involvements are characterized by the fact that keeping a bulldog grip upon the victim is of such vital interest to the sadist than his own life. Consequently, he is inclined to neglect his career, and will even to forgo the pleasures and advantages of meeting other people, rather than permit his partner any degree of independence.")]),a("p",[e._v("Very characteristic of sadistic impulses are the devices employed to enslave a love partner. These devices vary only within a comparatively limited range, depending upon the neurotic structure of both persons involved. Thus, the enslaved recipient will be given just enough to make the relationship appear worthwhile. And although the sadistic person will fulfill certain of the partner’s needs in a tantalizing, inadequate sort of way, he will at the same time impress upon him the unique quality of what he does give. Through brow-beating and intimidation, he will succeed in convincing his partner that nobody else would be capable of giving him such understanding, such powerful support, so much sexual satisfaction, so many varied interests, et cetera. In fact, who else would tolerate him? All these tactics achieve the desired goal — effectively isolating the partner from all contacts. And when, through the combined pressures of possessiveness on the one hand, and disparagement on the other, he is reduced to a state of complete dependency, then would be the moment selected by the sadist to threaten to leave him.")]),a("p",[e._v("We can use as illustrative material three pieces of literature: Henrik Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, and Søren Kierkegaard’s The Diary of a Seducer.

Hedda feels bitter resentment toward life because it has not fulfilled any of her expectations, and her resentment toward life is actively turned back onto life, and onto her environment. She actually has all that should make for happiness: security, a home, and a devoted husband; but for inner reasons, she can enjoy nothing. She is intelligent, very attractive, but she cannot love. Her life is actually empty and useless. Her permanent attitude is one of boredom, and beneath her boredom, we see a profound hopelessness. She is like a person who is tied to a tree at the fringe of a beautiful garden full of fruit, food, and water; she can look into the garden, but starves within the sight of its abundance. Although Hedda is unable to get anything out of life, she is by no means resigned.

A desperate inner suffering turns a person sour and venomous towards others. The attitude becomes: “If I can get nothing from life, why should you? I’ll make you pay for my unhappiness.”")]),a("p",[e._v("In Hedda’s case, the attempt to extract such payment from the people around her takes several characteristic forms. First, she makes endless demands.

Everything has been prepared her welcome home, but in return, she offers only criticism.")]),a("p",[e._v("Secondly, Hedda uses every opportunity to humiliate others, and is clever at finding people’s weak spots so that she can wound them even more effectively. In the second act, there is a telling example of this attitude. Her husband’s old aunt has bought a hat to honor Hedda’s arrival, and has left it in the living room. Hedda knows whose hat it is, but she picks it up with this remark: “Look there! the servant has left her old bonnet lying about on a chair.”")]),a("p",[e._v("Thirdly, Hedda tries always to enslave others, to have them constantly at her beck and call. She shows possessive jealousy, not only toward her husband, but toward an old friend, Ejlert Lövborg. Because another woman has helped him, Hedda drives Lövborg to suicide, and then with savage glee burns the manuscript which was his life’s work. In addition, she intimidates everyone around her; she has the capacity for inducing fears in all; everyone is fearful of not doing what she expects, and Hedda finds fault with everyone and with everything.")]),a("p",[e._v("Also, she shows an uncanny capacity to sense other people’s wishes, but only to frustrate them — never to fulfill them. She leads people skillfully and drops them at the moment when they will be apt to feel the disappointment most.

This compulsive resolution may even drive him to engage in his badness with a kind of frantic, feverish delight. Having pursued this course, he has succeeded merely in immeasurably widening the gap between his idealized concept of himself and his real self. Consequently, he is imbued with a sense of irretrievable loss and of hopelessness, and plunges into recklessness with a fanatical vigor.")]),a("p",[e._v("Such a person, it is easy to understand, would be driven to disparage others.

The satisfaction derived from this pernicious game is a thrill, comparable to the excitement of the hunter or the gambler.

She is a cold person, with seemingly no other side to her nature. The artist presents only the essentials, and Ibsen has simplified the picture very much. If we translate his account into everyday experience, we find many Hedda Gablers, both male and female, in our community, but either they are not so far gone in sadism as Hedda, or their natures show much more conflict. They will generally feel more need to deceive themselves and others into accepting them as fair, generous, sacrificing, and decent. They will show the same tendency to irritate those around them with endless demands, reproaches, humiliations, and exhibitions of possessive jealousy; but at the same time, they will not be in the least aware of such attitudes, and will probably feel misunderstood, neglected, and also abused. They do show that they possess at least a vision of charity, warmth, and love, though actually they deal with their partners in love in exactly the same way that Hedda does. When the picture of sadism is not so stark, the victim may be even more helpless, and will often feel more guilty, if he does not fulfill any of the exaggerated demands made upon him by the superior partner.")]),a("p",[e._v("In Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, Professor Higgins exemplifies sadistic tendencies very similar to those of Hedda Gabler. Professor Higgins is an elusive, ascetic man, and is emotionally quite dead. He is a person whom we could not possibly associate with the enjoyment of a good show, or a good joke, or a beautiful sunset. We cannot imagine him showing any affection. He is absorbed in his own ambitions, and even this ambition has a negative and cynical goal: it is, mainly, to fool society. Emotionally he is a sort of Zombie, entirely cut off from life — for we live only insofar as we feel, not more, and not less.")]),a("p",[e._v("In Pygmalion, Professor Higgins tries to turn Eliza Doolittle, an ignorant flower-girl from the London slums, into a lady; and in his behavior towards this girl, we find a repetition of many of Hedda’s attitudes. We see his complete disregard for the girl as a human being with rights of her own; we see the arrogance with which he dominates her, and makes her into a creature who responds to his demands and fulfills his wishes and his ambitions; and we see the cutting impatience of his criticism wherever she does not meet his very exacting requirements.")]),a("p",[e._v("We could round out this picture, too, and bring it nearer to the experience of everyday life. Then we should have someone who has another side to him, who is at least able to fall in love, and be at times charming and affectionate. Again we should see that there are many Professor Higginses. Such individuals are apt to find themselves attracted to people from lower economic levels—very much the same as in Pygmalion—with little education, or to people who are simply in trouble. To these unfortunates, they offer help, support, advice, and may actually be helpful, to a certain extent; but the help is usually given for the purpose of gaining a thrill in the power to rescue, to educate, or to mold another human being. They are immediately mortified when the creature they create shows signs of independence, or of attempts to enter into a real relationship with them, on terms of equality.")]),a("p",[e._v("The Diary of a Seducer, by Søren Kierkegaard, tells the story of a sophisticated man who succeeds in seducing a girl who is a virgin.

Every move he makes is carefully schemed to the last detail, and considered in the light of its possible effect on her: for instance, he may decide to keep her waiting five minutes, to see her, not to see her—it is all minutely mapped out. In this “seducer,” we see another example of a man who lives in his reason, a man for whom even physical desire is bare, meager, and completely intellectual. What he enjoys is the power he has to attract, and then reject; to arouse, and then disappoint another human being. He shows a completely callous disregard of what his attitude may mean to the girl. He is absorbed in the thrill of stimulating her sexually and then frustrating her, building her hopes and then crushing them, keeping her apprehensive of a break, and withdrawing at the exact point to cause the greatest suffering.")]),a("p",[e._v("In translating this third case into actual life, I am reminded of a patient of mine who believed himself madly in love with a girl, and who spent most of his time and thoughts in attempts to possess her. One side of his nature was unfeeling and calculating, yet he seemed very much in love. The girl on her part was obviously playing cat-and-mouse — and she continued, over a great number of months, to continue this cat-and-mouse game. I told him that there was nothing of love in his attitude towards this girl, though he did feel sexual desire. He later accepted and confirmed my interpretation. He confessed that though he finally proposed to the girl — and was refused — he had not given a thought to the possible development of such a relationship, to how it would work out and to what it would require of him. He had no thought further than to the moment when he would possess the girl, sexually. He pictured how he would enjoy tying and beating her.")]),a("p",[e._v("There you have the sadist! Attracting and rejecting; arousing and disappointing. By such means he is able to gain absolute power, and to feel the thrill which is so necessary to him, because he cannot really love or enjoy anything.

Very egotistical, you would probably say, and I certainly would agree with you. But it is an egotism of its own kind. It differs from the egotism we find in the wonderful study of a neurotic, What Makes Sammy Run? Sammy has simply no feeling for human relations. No moral values exist for him. All he wants is to make a career. Though he does step over people, it does not bother him, it does not even interest him, nor does it thrill him. The only thing that can excite him is to go a step ahead in his career. The egotism of the sadist differs also from that of a pleasure-loving person who only wants a good cigar, good food, good wine, and who does not mean to be bothered with anything else. Such a person is egotistical, but he can still enjoy something of life.")]),a("p",[e._v("Or one could say that sadistic people are hostile. This is certainly true. They no doubt have a great deal of hostility — but it, too, is of a special kind. We are all hostile at times. If someone hurts us, or attempts to interfere with our work or purposes, or commits an injustice, we all react with hostility. This is reactive hostility. But sadistic people are fascinated by their power to hurt, exploit, enslave, and to humiliate. Their attitude is quite different from reactive hostility. André Maurois describes their uncanny intuition for discovering exactly where others are the most vulnerable. He states, “X-rays which reveal the straw which breaks the beam’s stability,’ and this means that sadistic people are able to make unerringly, point out, find, and use the other’s vulnerable spots.")]),a("p",[e._v("Why don’t we call these people simply mean? Well, they are mean, or they do have mean streaks; but they are not born mean, and I think no one is. They have become mean through crushing experiences in their childhood. They have suffered not only too little respect and love, but in a positive way, they have suffered too many humiliations. Their experiences have left them determined to get even with the world. For most of them, there is also another side—a side which wants to be decent and fair—opposed to the desire for revenge. It is somewhat like the problem of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They have become so entangled in the conflict that they feel completely shut off from life. They go empty-handed. And that is why they want to get even with those who have humiliated them.")]),a("p",[e._v("So, we might call them vindictive people. Yes, if one single term which can describe the special quality of sadistic trends, it is vindictiveness — vindictiveness certainly comes nearest. They need to avenge themselves on two scores: on the one hand, for what they have gone through in childhood, experiences which have greatly undermined their pride and self-respect; on the other hand, for what these experiences have done to them, and are perpetually doing to them, in the present. What sustains the sadist’s attitude and makes it poignant is his further development, the distant end result of the early humiliations, the stifling and shriveling of his emotional life, the inner despair over himself. In spite of any surface bravado, he has given himself up as a bad and a hopeless job. He does not expect, and in many cases, defiantly, does not even want, what life has to offer.")]),a("p",[e._v("From this basis of bitter envy, resentment, and despair, he has come to want only two things: these are, first, to get even, and secondly, the enjoyment of vindictive triumphs. As he cannot enjoy anything, he must ruin others’ enjoyment. As he cannot feel pleasurable anticipation, he will mar the hopes and anticipations of others. And, as he has lost his pride and self-respect, he will constantly attempt to humiliate other people’s dignity as human beings, and degrade them into mere creatures whom he dominates and exploits. In spite of an aura of righteousness, he feels guilty; and therefore he must make others feel guilty constantly. His desire for vindictive triumph shows itself in a determination to gain a victory over all who have frustrated him, and also in a restless drive to excel. In some respects, the fairy tale of “Cinderella”—her early humiliations at the hands of her step-sisters, and her final triumph over them, illustrates this aspect of sadistic trends — the need to excel over others.")]),a("p",[e._v("However, the sadist’s desire for revenge is not merely expressions of his bitterness and resentment. It is also something else, and this is what makes it strong: it is his way of solving all of his problems. He regains his lost pride by crushing the pride of others; he recaptures a feeling of strength by the sense of power he acquires in enslaving and in controlling others; he rids himself of some measures of guilt by accusing other people and thereby making them feel constantly guilty.")]),a("p",[e._v("It is really amazing how much sadistic behavior can be manifested over a period of time without the individual himself realizing it, or recognizing it for what it actually is. He is merely sporadically aware of occasional inclinations to mistreat a weaker person, of being stimulated when he reads about sadistic acts, or of having some obviously sadistic fantasies. For the most part, he is unconscious of the significance of his daily behavior towards others. Until this numbness of feeling for himself and others is dispelled, he will not emotionally comprehend what he does. Unfortunately, the self-justifications that camouflage the sadistic trends are often clever enough to deceive not only the afflicted person, but those who are affected by him.")]),a("p",[e._v("Since sadism is the terminal stage of a very severe neurosis, the kind of justification employed will depend upon the structure of the particular neurosis from which the sadistic trends derive. For instance, the compliant type will enslave the partner under the unconscious pretense of love. His demands will be attributed to his special needs for attention, due to frailty or due to, perhaps, timidity. The aggressive type, on the other hand, although expressing sadistic tendencies quite openly, is not necessarily more aware of them. The detached person is characteristically unobtrusive in manifesting sadistic trends. He proceeds to quietly frustrate others, making them feel insecure by his readiness to withdraw, and subtly conveying the impression that they are cramping him, he takes secret delight in letting them make fools of themselves.")]),a("p",[e._v("From this exposition, it becomes clear that a person is not sadistic by nature. His attitudes are part and parcel of a neurosis, and need to be treated as such. Only a person who despairs of himself and life can be sadistic.

Brickner—in the chapter “The Paranoid and His Victim” in his book Is Germany Incurable?—holds that the more decent and fair a person is in his attitude toward a sadist, the more readily will he be victimized. I think that that is not always so. It is my experience that there is generally also something the matter with the person who becomes helplessly involved with a sadist.

This occurs without regard to the more tedious, drab realities of providing the right conditions in which love may take root and grow, and to the exclusion from awareness of the un-exciting tasks of looking after and taking responsibility for sustaining a mutually nurturing relationship — in sickness and in health.

Since it is so important, the question might well be raised, is it possible to overemphasize or overrate love? Does not the danger lie rather in underrating its importance? Would not the world be a far better place in which to live if people loved more? Might this not be the answer to the age-old problem of how to eliminate war and other forms of human strife? And then there are the children — is it possible for them to have too much love?

Nevertheless, if we expect of love what it cannot give, or anticipate its benefits under faulty circumstances, it will not grow. Nor can it possibly be of true service to us. This at bottom is a banal truth and applies not only to love. When, for instance, we plant strawberry seeds, we do not expect apples to grow, nor do we expect the plants to lay eggs, provide shade, or produce wood for the fireplace. All good things need cultivating. To get strawberries, we must plant the seeds properly, in the right kind of soil, supplying the moisture, sun, and shade required by this particular type of plant. Later, we would have to re-plant the young shoots when they have reached the right stage of development, and tend them continuously. That we do not see these relations as clearly in love has to do with love being less tangible, less concrete than strawberries. Therefore we can more easily harbor illusions on this score.")]),a("p",[e._v("Let us ask now, how can we discover whether we overemphasize love or whether somebody else does. It is not an easy task. However, for all practical purposes, it can be assumed that some of our longing for love is normal. But it is essential that we be on the alert to observe, and to analyze, every element in it that is of a compulsive nature, for it is precisely this compulsive aspect that denotes a neurotic exploitation of love. An irrational attitude toward love is revealed, for instance, in the rather frequent assumption that it is only “natural,” especially for a woman, to be desperate if a fiancé does not call or write, or for a woman to go to pieces if her husband goes out with another woman, or for a woman to claim all her husband’s or lover’s time, even begrudging him a natural interest in his business.")]),a("p",[e._v("Throughout this lecture, I shall speak in terms of the woman who overemphasizes love because such an attitude is not only encouraged, but exaggerated by our culture. It is, however, not a problem which has to do essentially with femininity. It may concern men as well. In general, we can gauge the degree of dependency upon love by observing the position it occupies in the total scheme of our lives. If, for instance, all our interests, desires, plans, and fears revolve around love, our days will be filled with, and our minds occupied by, such fruitless questions as, “Why doesn’t he write oftener?”; “Will he come home early this evening?”; “Why doesn’t he call?”; “How much does he really love me?” It can easily be understood that as a consequence of this desperate constriction of our energies and interests, all else in life becomes meaningless, and that time’s passage is made memorable merely by the punctuated silence occasioned by the ringing of the phone or doorbell, which inevitably is followed by a frantic question, “Is it he?” Obviously there is no room in such life for mere friends, or for productive work. These people, being thus dependent on love, often have plenty of neurotic troubles, like feeling tense, having fears, inhibitions, timidities, et cetera. In analysis, we can observe that all of life[’s] problems — that they believe that all of life[’s] problems would be magically solved for them if only they had the right husband or lover.")]),a("p",[e._v("Another way to discover a neurotic attitude towards love is to observe the reactions of deep despair and depression occasioned by any slight frustration in the realm of love. People who exhibit such extreme reactions — quite out of proportion to the real significance of a situation — feel desolate when not in the company of their partners, and are irreparably humiliated by any form of neglect, irrespective of extenuating circumstances. And when such people ask themselves, “why doesn’t he write,” what is actually implied by their query is the blindly insistent injunction “he should write,” or “he would write if he really loved me.” Also implied, of course, is the neurotic assumption, “if he really loved me — as I love him — then nothing else, no one else, could possibly be more important to him at any time. In any instance, whether it is this extreme dependency on the partner, there is a frenzied clinging that is not only degrading but that inevitably fosters a terror of being deserted. As a result, the entire relationship is disturbed. And when the partner, too, is neurotic, the malady is considerably aggravated by the operation of externally conflicting trends. Thus, for instance, a detached partner might well be exasperated by such persistent encroachments upon his precious isolation. A sadistic partner, on the other hand, would be inclined to misuse and exploit the dependency. These, then, are the features that characterize a neurotic overemphasis on love. In any normal love relationship, some of them may be present.")]),a("p",[e._v("But if the entire character structure presents evidence of the existence of all of these symptoms, the condition is of a decidedly harmful nature. For inevitably, the effects are crippling to the entire personality, in addition to causing acute suffering. People vary considerably, both in their comprehension of, and their response to this neurotic symptom in themselves. Those who do not understand its significance consider their behavior completely natural. Others, sensing a deficiency, are inclined to place the responsibility outside of themselves. Life, they claim, has offered them nothing but bad breaks. They are certain that everything would be fine if only the right person came along. This mythical being, presumably, would have to be a de-personalized paragon of devotion, very really to satisfy the exorbitant claims made upon him.")]),a("p",[e._v("But there are others, who have a clear realization of their state of dependency, and who earnestly desire to liberate themselves. They have become acutely aware of the havoc wrought, not only upon their personality, but upon their entire life. For them, the problem is how to cope with this excessive need for love. They must question their deepest, most fundamental expectations of love. In doing so, they may first discover that their extreme dependency upon it is partly due to a rather constant fear of hostility on the part of others. This was illustrated by a patient who brought in a picture she had drawn in which she had portrayed herself as an infant, surrounded by menacing animals and insects — a bull, a cat, and a bee — all threatening the infant’s life. This picture was an unconscious revelation of her real and basic fear of people. To her, they appeared strange and menacing, and in their presence she felt infantile in her helplessness to cope with them in any kind of human relationship. It is understandable, therefore, why such a woman depends so much upon her husband or lover. Not for love, but rather, because of her need for acceptance and security.")]),a("p",[e._v("Love has a reassurance value for those who overemphasize it precisely because they themselves feel so defenseless. Consequently, they regard their partners essentially as allies against a hostile world. This becomes evident, for instance, when a woman insists that her husband make arrangements with the landlord for household repairs. She may even go so far as to expect him to assert his authority when the maid becomes difficult. In general, she counts upon him to defend her against others, including, for instance, her own relatives.")]),a("p",[e._v("Are we to understand, now, that such people are by nature inclined to be too soft? Or altogether lacking in self-assertiveness? This may not be so at all. As a matter of fact, they frequently do reveal a certain degree of aggressiveness, although indirectly. For without being aware of it, they may haunt their partners by their clinging, or by constantly demonstrating their disappointment and misery. They seem to be afraid, though, to be aggressive, and act as if they had neither spunk nor initiative. They lean over backwards to be agreeable, and frequently are apologetic, as well as too yielding, or too appeasing. At the same time, however, they smart beneath the burden of the subordinate role in which they have placed themselves. A wife who makes exclusive claims upon love looks upon her husband as the mainstay of her existence. She expects him to be not only an adequate provider, but an effective intermediary between her and all life situations. Thus she manages to protect herself from the hazards of asserting her insecure self or of making faulty decisions. She may even persuade herself into the conviction that his love must have endowed him with a sensitivity expressly attuned to her unexpressed wishes. And, inevitably, she regards herself as winsomely helpless and fragile. In view of all these things, it is only natural, therefore, that such a woman frequently is attracted to an aggressive man. Aware of her own lack, she desires resourcefulness in her partner. More important, even, she feels that with a strong or aggressive partner, she can remain safe in her weakness. Unfortunately, despite the undeniable shrewdness of her logic, this course is destined to perpetuate her malady.")]),a("p",[e._v("Overemphasis on love is revealed, also, in those who depend upon the love and admiration of others to bolster up their self-confidence. The state of their morale is determined pretty much by the amount and degree of devotion and admiration that surround them. In the absence of such bolstering, their basic feeling of insignificance leads them to become hypercritical of themselves, since they lack the sense of security that is essential to accurate and dependable self-evaluation. Others take inordinate pride in their partner’s achievements, simply because they are able to bask in the warm glow of reflected glory. However, theirs is a worn and limp sort of existence. For they have succeeded merely in living vicariously. The emotionally dead, as well as those whose feelings have been consistently and rigidly repressed that they have become inaccessible to normal stimuli, nevertheless look to a love relationship for the emotional warmth and vitality that they so sadly lack and need. No longer able to tap their own resources, they are lured away from their own shortcomings and stimulated into a pseudo- sort of well-being and self-confidence by an ebullient partner. The myth-makers of old showed a discerning observation of this aspect of love dependency in their narratives about the old man or woman who felt more alive after sleeping with a youthful person. Strangely enough, these people labor under the illusion that it is really possible to acquire vitality from others, much in the manner in which plants absorb nourishment from the soil.")]),a("p",[e._v("Yet even plants have to make something of what they absorb. It would seem, then, that these people have consigned themselves to a parasitical state in life. To sustain and fortify their illusions, they are strongly inclined to endow love with truly magical powers and qualities. Like Cinderella in the fairy-tale, or like Madame Bovary, in Flaubert’s realistic delineation of a romantic attachment, they regard love as an ‘open sesame’ to fantastically happy living, and under its miraculous aegis, they confidently hope to acquire all that which they lack — strength, assurance, warmth, and magnetism — in short, a completely rounded vision of happiness. But the outcome is always the same. Their dreams, their illusions, their fantasies eventually become like leaden weights that strangulate the beloved. In summary, we may say that people who are alienated from themselves, who are possessed of neurotic fears, and who are incapable of utilizing their own resources, are compelled to live through others. Their predicament is due largely to an aversion against changing themselves in any way, and to their subsequent dependence upon miraculous and external solutions. Because they cannot cope with life as it is, they escape into an idealized realm wherein love, devotion, and sacrifice are glorified, and make the principal activating forces in the lives of others. For them, however, love remains illusory. They are incapable of giving it; hence, incapable of receiving it.")]),a("p",[e._v("Let us consider, now, what we must be and do, if we expect to reap the benefits of love. Such fulfillment can be achieved only if we ourselves have the capacity for love and are willing to make the necessary personal adjustments essential to its proper utilization. Those who are neurotically dependent upon love are too often disposed to disregard their own responsibilities. Despite their deification of love as the only worthwhile thing in life, it never occurs to them to question their own qualifications as active participants or deserving recipients. They are far more inclined to take love for granted. Although it is my belief that everyone is endowed with the potential capacity for love, nevertheless experience teaches that all the fears, weaknesses, pretenses, and excessive demands that many of us make upon love deprive us of its eventual fulfillments. My convictions concerning our inherent potentialities have been fortified considerably by my analytical experience. I have seen people, liberated from constricting fears and inhibitions, become more realistic in their attitude toward love. This indicates that their emotional capacities have been successfully tapped and their love impulses effectively channeled. Obviously, this could not have been achieved had the patient been inherently lacking in this capacity, for it is not within the power of the analyst to instill in the patient what was not already present.")]),a("p",[e._v("It would be pertinent at this point to inquire of ourselves why we so rarely consider our own capacities and qualifications as lovers. Might not the answer be that in our culture, we are inclined to confuse equality with capacity, or to assume that opportunity in itself denotes fulfillment? Thus we assume, for instance, that everyone is equally capable of being a good mother, a good lover, or a good citizen in a democracy. How valid are these assumptions? Let us limit ourselves for the time being to the sphere of love, since that is our particular interest for the moment. Isn’t it true that many of us deliberately avoid analyzing our capacities as lovers? And might not be the reason that we are fearful of losing our illusions about ourselves? Instead, we exert all our effort and ingenuity in preserving the grand illusion that we are great lovers. Perhaps nothing in our present culture reveals this better than our fondness for the movies. For does not the popularity of this entertainment medium derive largely from our neurotic propensity towards identifying ourselves with the ideal lover in his successful exploits, or with the femme fatale whose repose will absorb the worship of her lovers, like a flower raised towards the sun?")]),a("p",[e._v("On the other hand, to some the mere idea of love is appealing that they make neurotic attempts to appear lovable, and engage in unconscious strategies to win approval and admiration, but in their avid quest for love, they characteristically overlook its basic qualifications: friendliness, loyalty, considerateness, warmth. Instead, they refashion themselves to become merely appeasing, docile, ingratiating, and abjectly diffident. Because they mistake their unconscious strategies for the real thing, they delude themselves into thinking that they are blessed with an exceptional loving nature.")]),a("p",[e._v("Let us review, now, the factors that commonly interfere with the capacity to love and that subsequently lead to failure in any close relationship. To begin with, neurotic people are too self-centered, and consequently evaluate a partner in terms of their own needs. Possessed of a false sense of their own worth, they find it difficult, perhaps impossible, to give themselves. Also, their constant fear of self-disclosure compels them to retreat behind a façade of hypothetical virtues, which gradually they incorporate into a spurious reality. Furthermore, neurotic individuals are too vulnerable and too easily hurt because of their excessive expectations. Since their neurotic conflicts compel them to create their magnificent illusions about themselves, they are easily humiliated by the uninitiated who do not share the secret of their uniqueness. And, living so much in the world of their imagination, they eventually lose touch with their own reality as well as with the reality of their close associates. Finally, those who overemphasize love jeopardize their chances for its fulfillment because they are so unaware of the excessive demands that they make. Dwelling in their imagination, they feel entitled to expectations on a fantastic scale. In view of these attitudes, it is easy to understand why neurotic people regard the so-called ‘unconditional love’ as the ideal state of being. Seen from the vantage point of the partner, however, this neurotic ideal actually means ‘unconditional surrender.’ Imbued with the knowledge of their own insufficiency, they are obliged to cast about for devious and subtle ways of commanding the devotion and admiration that are so necessary to them.")]),a("p",[e._v("The analytic situation clearly reveals what happens to the neurotic person who has come to regard love as a panacea for all the difficulties ensuing from his unresolved conflicts. This attitude is especially well illustrated in the instances of some women patients who confidently declare to their male analysts, “If you would only love me, all my problems would be solved.” Clearly and definitely, they do not wish to be analyzed. Much less do they wish to alter themselves in any way. They grant the desirability of change and adjustments in the general scheme of things, but the general activity, they assume, must proceed from the outside. Circumstances should be improved; the analyst should do the work; other people should do the adjusting. Being driven within themselves by inner, egocentric compulsions, they can appreciate emotions and events only in terms of their own isolated and distorted values.")]),a("p",[e._v("It was Freud’s contention that such people are biologically so constituted as to require sexual gratification beyond the needs of the average person. This view predicated a fatalistic outlook for the patient, leaving him the hopeless and unhappy victim of his abnormal physiological makeup. It is my opinion, however, that this is not really the case. For in analysis, such unhappy situations eventually reveal themselves to be of distinctly neurotic — rather than physiological — origin. Over and over again, they tell the sad tale of dependency, of the escape from reality, and of the fantastic expectation that love will triumph over all obstacles and solve all problems. Implied in the classical Greek definition of tragedy is the conviction that man is forever subjected to, and controlled by, the idle caprices of sterner wills of the gods. In this light, too, should we understand the tragedy that encompasses the lives of those neurotic people who worship at the shrine of love. They cannot know love’s fulfillment because, like the characters in a Greek tragedy, their fortunes and their reverses are constantly at the mercy of their own exploitive drives for a security that forever remains a will-of-the-wisp. Such people have not love, nor have they lived.")]),a("p",[e._v("Even if they regarded love as one of the crucial factors in neurosis, Freud and his followers have given insufficient consideration to the meaning of this phenomenon. They were content to regard love — in whatever context it appeared — as some manifestation of the sex instinct. Actually, the desire to be loved, appreciated, or admired plays a powerful role in neurosis. As I tried to show in my book The Neurotic Personality of Our Time [1937], the intensity and pervasiveness of this craving are, in large part, the result of an underlying fear of people. The neurotic need for affection is an attempt to allay such fear. But even more than that, it is an attempt to remedy a poignant incapacity to accept oneself. For, indeed, these self-impose inferiority or guilt feelings are a heavy burden to bear. In the process of every analysis, we see how frequently the neurotic turns against himself, frustrating and berating himself in a manner that is clearly sadistic. Recently, I have seen some excellent illustrations of just such behavior. After attending a lecture, a patient had left with some very stimulating ideas of his own. In fact, the enthusiasm of the moment inspired him to consider developing his ideas along literary lines. Immediately, however, the cynical voice of self-contempt cried out, “You conceited fool! You think you can write?” In another patient, revealed itself through internal dialogue. Thus, confidently, he thinks, “Thank goodness! Tonight, I shall sleep my head off,” while that other voice snidely remarks, “Oh no you won’t.” These are but a few examples — which I could easily multiply by the hundred — which illustrate how, mostly without knowing it, the neurotic constantly frustrates himself as well as the very people who love him. Co-existent with corrosive self-contempt is the neurotic’s pathetic dependence upon the opinions, admiration, and love of others. His argument is, “If I am loved by somebody, then I cannot be so bad. I must really amount to something.” Obviously, the dependence upon the approval of everyone makes a neurotic extremely vulnerable, because if he feels rejected, or is rejected, then his falsely gained, spurious self-esteem drops immediately to zero. In this way, the need to love, or to be loved, may become compulsive. There is nothing voluntary about such love. It is prompted by dire necessity.")]),a("p",[e._v("The question arises: Since neurotic love is in a sense compulsive, has it therefore no redeeming virtues? This question may appear strange coming from me, inasmuch as I have so often talked about the detrimental effects of the compulsive need for love — how we are disappointed in it, and how it affects others; how such love is lacking in real warmth; its incapacity to allay our fears, or to help us to live in peace with ourselves. All of this is quite true, and I retract none of it. Yet I wonder whether, even in this neurotic distortion, love does not retain some of its inherent constructive power. I would not have raised this question were I not familiar with a certain type of patient in whose life love apparently plays no role.")]),a("p",[e._v("I am thinking, for instance, of a patient whose neurotic structure necessitated the absolute exclusion of love. He had a mother, an older sister and brothers, all of whom treated him sadistically. In fact, there was almost no love in their relationships to him. Inevitably, he became a neurotic person — a person who expected only hostility from others. Furthermore, in the course of the evolution of his neurosis, he developed a hatred for himself, a need to turn against himself, to tear himself apart in a sadistic way. This self-destructive impulse was so dangerous for him that it necessitated the adoption of defensive attitudes of arrogance and self-righteousness. As a result, he constantly courted hostility with his pontifical conviction, “I am always right! It is the others who are wrong.” He could maintain this conviction of unsullied rectitude only, however, at the expense of all human feelings. Thus, other people acting in a friendly manner toward one another frightened him. To defend himself, he had to consider as neurotic all expressions of mutuality and congeniality. Even so, with a defiance bristling with bitterness, we would proclaim, cynically, “There is no such thing as real goodness.”")]),a("p",[e._v("This patient developed what I would call the ‘closed system’ — one which would brook no interference from the outside. No giving, no receiving. Since he did not wish to be corrupted by any emotions — his own or others — he was driven in the direction of asceticism. One can readily see that this situation provided a minimal incentive for growth. Because he had become almost suffocated in his grim armor of rectitude, there was almost no appeal that you could make to anything in this man, for none of the things that are meaningful to others had any real meaning for him. But if you compare people like this — who, fortunately, are rarely in the extremity that I have just described — with the type of neurotic individual who has a compulsive need for affection, then you will sense the difference. For no matter how distorted this need for affection may be, it nevertheless proclaims the affirmative, “I do want something! I do want a good relationship with people.” It is precisely this affirmative attitude towards life which makes such an individual accessible to therapy, makes him interested in all the factors in himself that alienate him from desirable relationships with people. For this reason, we could say that even in its neurotic, distorted form, love, or a desire for love, still retains some of its constructive and beneficent powers.")]),a("p",[e._v("What, then, is love — real love? Is it merely a romantic illusion? Does it necessitate living through another in a state of dependency, or sadistically? These questions are frequently raised. Yet, while they are scientifically valid, they are not the reason for our scientific interest.What we sense in them is a note of distress — a protest against what is felt as debunking — an anxious plea, “Is there nothing but neurotic love?” And this question is of the utmost value. But are we debunking love? I do not believe that we are. What we are seeing, and with reasonable conviction, is that neurosis impairs the capacity to give and to receive love. In some cases, this very incapacity creates a compulsive need for love, while in others, it leads to a defensiveness and hostility. Fortunately, however, even a neurotic love, though it may be impaired, is rarely completely submerged, for there always a remains a part of ourselves that is not determined by unconscious or ulterior motives, that is not given to secretive manipulations, that does not, in short, consider other people as means toward an end. To put it positively, there exists within all of us some degree of genuine sympathy — a sincere liking for others, for what they are. There is real enjoyment in being together, in sharing both joy and sorrow. And there is, too, the deep satisfaction in helping in the growth of another, and in the warm, close feeling of growing together. All of this is real love. But if this description does not suffice, I can do no better than quote Paul’s advice in the thirteenth chapter of his first letter to the Corinthians, for I do not think that it has ever been equaled as a definition of love. You will note that I have substituted ‘love’ for the word ‘charity’ wherever it appears in the text quoted below, because, it seems to me that ‘love’ is the more pertinent term for us today.")]),a("p",[e._v("And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing. 4 Love suffereth long, and is kind.

Discussing the personal life in his book Reason and Emotion, he finds chastity as the capacity to love whole-heartedly, without ulterior motives. Macmurray distinguishes between personal relationships, entered into for their inherent value to the participants, and relationships which are developed and cultivated for some purpose. The latter he defines as functional relationships. For instance, if you work with others on the auxiliary council, or in a union, or in a scientific group, you don’t come together primarily because you like to see each other. You may enjoy their company, but your main purpose in associating with them is the work to be done. In contrast to this, a personal relationship is one into which we enter for no other purpose than the relationship itself, in which we can express our whole selves in an atmosphere of mutuality and fellowship. It is difficult to find a word to express the unique quality of such a relationship — not because our language is inadequate, but because the more familiar words have been bandied about so much that they have come to mean either too much or too little.")]),a("p",[e._v("Indeed, through constant misuse, they have accumulated such a variety of emotional connotations that they blur our concept of what they precisely denote. Take, for example, the words ‘friendship,’ ‘fellowship,’ ‘communion.’ Each conveys a part of the meaning. But what is common to them all is a relationship between people which has no purpose beyond itself, in which they associate because it is natural for human beings to share their experiences, to understand each other, to find joy and satisfaction in living together, in expressing and revealing themselves to one another. If we ask why people form friendships, or love one another, the question must remain unanswerable. We can simply say that it is the nature of people to do so, for only in this way can they truly fulfill themselves. Essentially, both Paul and Macmurray agree that the very value of love does not lie in something mysterious or ecstatic. Nor, certainly, is it confined to sexual satisfaction. Rather, it is to be characterized by the quality of the relationship between two people and their capacity to give whole-heartedly in this relationship.")]),a("p",[e._v("To be sure, the ‘love’ we speak of is often confused with ‘falling in love.’ No one will deny that it is a wonderful feeling, but let us always remember that it is the easiest part of love, its most charming aspect. It is also the part in which we deceive ourselves most frequently, insofar as we are inclined to mistake for love, for instance, what actually may be a wish to conquer, or simple sexual desire. This confusion is not only fostered by the movies, but glamorized and romanticized. In our celluloid romances, people eventually embrace each other. From there on, we are free to suppose that they live happily ever after. Thus, movies seduce us, willingly enough, from the uncomfortable problems of reality, into every human being’s most delightful pastime, ‘wishful thinking.’ Indeed, they make it all too easy for us to assume what cannot and should not be taken for granted. Even the directors and producers realize that although our ability to love is impaired, we are nevertheless highly susceptible to its more ingratiating gestures. Exploiting this rather commonplace human weakness, they consistently throw the spotlight on the romantic aspects of being in love, pretty much to the exclusion of the paler and more sober realities.")]),a("p",[e._v("Such erroneous attitudes are bound to result in a gross underestimation of the human elements which are really the most important factors in the relationship. As a consequence of such misconceptions, people are wont to talk ever so glibly about friendship. They would refer to a casual travel acquaintance as “my very best friend.” Or they may say, “I have so many — ten, twenty — very best friends.” All of which, of course, is quite impossible. On the other hand, sometimes they casually remark, “Oh, that’s merely a friendship.” Or they may terminate a sexual relationship with a coy proposal, “But we can still be friends.” When speaking of friendship, it is easy to belittle it without realizing that it really is a serious expression of a cultural dilemma. With the many disturbances in our personal relationships, which are the outgrowth of our living in a changing world, and in a competitive civilization, we all have a measure of anxiety, and we all need affection. At the same time, however, we are inhibited in love for the very same reasons. And so we start to pretend, to make-believe, that we have friends, or that friendship may be had for the mere asking. In my opinion, the very essence of love is friendship at its best.")]),a("p",[e._v("What, then, we must ask ourselves, is it that gives love its unique significance? We might reply that it offers so many possibilities of making us happy. But I don’t think that this, while it most certainly is true, answers the question satisfactorily. For surely there are many other things that bring us happiness — for instance, our work. Then, too, not even the greatest love is immune to sorrow and hardships. For all of these reasons, we must be more specific in expressing its unique value. All that I am about to say about this question hinges upon the demonstrable fact that human relationships are the most essential part of our life, and that the quality of these relationships constitutes much of what is specifically human.")]),a("p",[e._v("To begin with, love carries us out of our emotional isolation — loneliness, egocentricity — in short, out of our exclusive concern for ourselves. Sex alone may also do that. Even infatuation may crack the shell that encases and imprisons a personality. But love does much more. It affords the opportunity for sharing — sharing responsibility, sharing joy, sharing good, giving mutual assistance. Then, too, love offers the possibility of feeling at peace and at home, of feeling, “Here, I have roots, something I need.” Our life is so strenuous, so precarious, that this restful sense of being entirely welcome is doubly important to us in that it carries with it the assurance that our welcome derives not from possible fame or fortune, but from what we ourselves really are.")]),a("p",[e._v("This does not mean, of course, that we should abuse the spirit of a relaxing home environment, by using it as a convenient opportunity to blow off steam or to fly off the handle, or even to abandon all the amenities of civilized living, all at the expense of a patient spouse. On the contrary, it is highly important for us to cherish a congenial home environment for its real value to us, providing an atmosphere of good will, of welcome, and of warm appreciation. And finally there is the plain fact — the essential point of this lecture — that love will always be the most effective stimulus to human growth. We cannot grow in a vacuum. How, actually, does a person grow? To begin with, love provides us with powerful incentives to overcome our shortcomings and difficulties. Our human frailties are bound to appear in any close love relationship. You can be an excellent teacher, social worker, businessman, or executive, without revealing many of your personal shortcomings. Your position may provide conditions which enable you to function easily, such as deferential recognition or rewards for ambition. You may even withhold large parts of your personality from such a situation. But, in a close relationship, any disturbance that you have is bound to manifest itself sooner or later. Whether it be hypersensitivity to hurts, an arrogant insistence upon having your own way, abject dependence upon the wishes or approval of others, an overbearing conviction of the infallibility of your judgment, or any other eccentricity of yours, it will reveal itself in a close relationship, and it is certain to cause friction. On the other hand, if you really desire and value a sound companionship, then you will bend every effort to avoid hurting your partner, or ruining the relationship, and as soon as you become aware that you have done either, you will begin to examine yourself to discover what factors in yourself are interfering with the proper growth of that desirable relationship.")]),a("p",[e._v("Whatever changes ensue from this self-analysis enrich not only you but your partner as well. So, too, if your partner changes for the better, in response to your sympathetic encouragement, not only you, nor he, but the partnership as a whole has benefitted. For it must always be understood that it is mutual interest which provides the most powerful incentive for undertaking the painful task of self-examination and change for the better. Furthermore, any moderately good love relationship provides opportunities for mutual help in this respect. And by mutual help, I definitely do not mean that people in love should engage in analyzing each other. So used, analysis may become a very destructive tool, and at best may lead merely to feelings of frustration on the part of both people.")]),a("p",[e._v("As I see it, mutual help is something quite different. I am thinking of the very simple fact that not only do people in love have very strong reactions to each other, but that the closeness of their relationship enables them to discuss their reactions to each other in a friendly spirit of give-and-take. Consider, for example, the situation of the wife who is sexually responsive some nights, but disconcertingly frigid on others. Wondering what the trouble might be, her husband in all probability would make an earnest attempt to discover the difficulty. A frank discussion of the matter might reveal hypersensitiv[ity] on her part, or some aggressiveness on his part, of which he may not even be aware. In any case, such a discussion could help to develop a sound partnership. In this manner, both partners may grow more secure in the feeling that they are accepted, despite their shortcomings, or at least that they are not condemned nor rejected because of them.")]),a("p",[e._v("At this point, you may well ask, “But does not the analytic relationship provide a similar situation?” Yes, it does — because there, too, the patient can freely express himself without fear of being rejected or condemned. Unfortunately, however, not everybody can be analyzed. Moreover, a love relationship contains one factor which the analytic relationship does not have, either to the same degree or to the same extent: namely, the factor of mutuality in assistance. That, in itself, is highly conducive to the development of all the qualities that are so essential to our human growth: tolerance, considerateness, sympathy, a feeling of “we,” rather than the barren and isolated “I.” These are the possible gains. On the other hand, we must be aware of the fact that anything which has such power to help may, if not properly used, become a destructive force. And the destructive aspect, unfortunately, is not so rare that all of us have not observed the evidence of its encroachment upon happiness, leaving little else but disappointment, disenchantment, and bitterness. But whether the one or the other will be the outcome in any given situation depends on both partners, and to a much greater extent than is usually assumed. As with any other good thing, this sort of love does not fall into our laps. It is difficult to obtain and requires effort.")]),a("p",[e._v("How are we to qualify ourselves for it? First, we must have the willingness and capacity for a friendly acceptance of the partner as he really is. By that, I do not mean a blindness to shortcomings. For certainly, idealization of the partner — or what is worse, mutual admiration — may be quite pleasant for a time, for I do not believe that anyone minds being admired, but there is much to be said against it, because we are destined to disappointment. The act of idealization implies putting another person on a pedestal, which is dangerous both for him and for yourself. It also carries with it the wish and the expectation that you, too, be idealized. But it also means that you are too exacting — that rather than considering the ideals of your partner, you insist upon imposing your own upon him and demanding that he live up to them. This is a sin against a fundamental sense of accepting the other person as he is, which implies the full realization that he is a different person, with different needs, and probably one with different wishes from those that you have. Consequently, idealization is not useful in helping us to grow, chiefly because it blurs our critical vision, prevents us from seeing the things that should be changed.")]),a("p",[e._v("On the other hand, I do not mean that having a critical eye is synonymous with fault-finding. So many people pride themselves on being realistic when actually they are merely peering through the cracked mirror of their own discontent. In any case, criticisms that are made in a fault-finding spirit will not be helpful because they have been made without a true perspective of the whole situation. Such people will look only at the shortcomings and will have no appreciation of the whole person. Accepting the partner as he really is would also include not making him responsible for what he is not and hence for what he cannot be responsible [for being].")]),a("p",[e._v("What does such acceptance imply? Does it mean being aware of all the aspects of his personality? Certainly, that is part of what is meant, but the awareness should be of a constructive nature. For one can be aware of the person and of the many facets of his personality, yet harbor a feeling of mere tolerance. That is not being constructive. Thinking constructively means being aware of assets and shortcomings, always with the conviction that these shortcomings are neither fatal nor final. Acceptance has a further meaning which it is difficult for me to describe. When an artist paints a picture, he presents what he considers essential in the landscape, omitting the irrelevant. In the Bible, we learn that man sees what is before his eyes, but God sees the heart. I don’t mean that we should assume that divine faculty, but we might strive a little in that direction.")]),a("p",[e._v("A second qualification for love is the feeling of mutuality, which implies the existence of some basis of equality. There will be plenty of differences, but within the realm of friendship and love, there should be equality in the sense that both partners are equally entitled to respect and considerateness. There should be also an equal share in making efforts. Moreover, mutuality distinctly implies a feeling of we, that this is our life, these are our goals, this is our happiness. Why is this mutuality so difficult for the neurotic person? Principally because, as a result of his basic anxiety, he is unconsciously ruled by the feeling of “I against the world.” He tends to suspect everyone and to expect everyone to be hostile. He would like to exclude his partner from this grim picture, but often cannot do so. Sooner or later, even the partner will belong to those potentially hostile people. Then, too, because the neurotic is so imbued with a sense of his own weakness, he often develops a defensive feeling of superiority and arrogance. Thus, in a relationship that he considers mutual, he nevertheless expects his partner to make all the adjustments. He assumes that criticism is a faculty that only he may exercise, while expecting graciousness and frankness from her. These, it must be understood, are unconscious claims which may take a long time to bring into a patient’s awareness. Finally, a good love relationship requires emotional sincerity — that is, the whole-hearted expression not only of thoughts but of feelings. Here, we might well recall Macmurray’s words, “Chastity is the ability to love wholeheartedly, without ulterior motives.”")]),a("p",[e._v("We are, by and large, much less appreciative of emotional sincerity, than of intellectual integrity. Emotional sincerity implies not only withholding the expression of feelings we do not have, it also assumes the willingness to express those which are immeasurably important to another. Unfortunately, the neurotic often is afraid of having any positive feelings, preferring rather to be sadistic and frustrating. Consequently, he may restrain his emotions, regarding them as a weakness. Although the neurotic is badly equipped for love, he is not excluded from it. For his capacity as a rule is not dead, but impaired. And, despite his many handicaps, love offers even him the greatest possibility for growth. But it is essential that he should want a good relationship.")]),a("p",[e._v("What we see during the course of an analysis is that when one partner improves, the other improves also. This shows that the vicious circle, wherein the more the one clings, the more the other withdraws, can be reversed. This is also possible without analysis — if, instead of being too convinced that the fault is on the other side, or too resigned to the notion that “I just don’t love him,” we honestly search for our own share in each difficulty that arises. But this is difficult and requires much self-discipline.")]),a("p",[e._v("In conclusion, I should like to say a few very simple things. Love is of the utmost value for our growth. But it is no fairy-tale land. As with all things, it requires cultivation and conscientious effort. This should be common knowledge, but unfortunately it isn’t. We acquire all the background necessities for our work, but we are not prepared for what is most important: a love relationship.")])])],1)],1)],1),a("Footer")],1)},ji=[],qi={name:"a12",components:{Footer:J,"vuetify-audio":gt["a"]},data:function(){return{file:"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/karen-horney.appspot.com/o/11.mp3?alt=media&token=b713f47e-180d-4feb-b072-061d211cc096"}},methods:{audioFinish:function(){console.log("If You see this, it means the audio has finished playing.")}}},Vi=qi,Ji=(a("039c"),Object(c["a"])(Vi,Li,ji,!1,null,"9e224c62",null)),Oi=Ji.exports;f()(Ji,{VCardText:R["a"],VCardTitle:K["a"],VContainer:U["a"],VFlex:L["a"],VLayout:q["a"]});var Gi=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",[a("v-container",[a("v-layout",[a("v-flex",{staticClass:"text",attrs:{xs12:""}},[a("v-card-title",{staticClass:"titl"},[e._v("Karen Horney as a Humanistic Therapist")]),a("v-card-text",{staticClass:"cont"},[e._v("By Jacquie Simon Gunn")]),a("v-card-text",{staticClass:"h4"},[e._v("Jacquie Simon Gunn situates Karen Horney as a Humanistic therapist")]),a("br"),a("br"),a("div",[a("youtube",{attrs:{"video-id":"y-1cbEbOJ4E"}})],1)],1)],1)],1),a("Footer")],1)},Ui=[],Yi={name:"a13",components:{Footer:J}},$i=Yi,Zi=(a("7778"),Object(c["a"])($i,Gi,Ui,!1,null,"b9504e62",null)),Qi=Zi.exports;f()(Zi,{VCardText:R["a"],VCardTitle:K["a"],VContainer:U["a"],VFlex:L["a"],VLayout:q["a"]});var Xi=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",[a("v-container",[a("v-layout",[a("v-flex",{staticClass:"text",attrs:{xs12:""}},[a("v-card-title",{staticClass:"titl"},[e._v("\n          Robert C.

Since classical Greek literature and its Aristotelian criticism to the modern times many academic theorists have their specific perspectives on this controversy, depending on their distinct perception of the nature and function of literature in human society. Aristotle, Bradley, Forster, Knights, modern structuralists, recent psychoanalysts, and contemporary cognitive narratologists have been discussing and keep on disagreeing about the comparative importance of character versus plot. Marvin Mudrick as well as Robert Scholes and Robert Kellogg classify literary characters as ‘mimetic/semiotic’, and ‘aesthetic/illustrative/mimetic’. In both kinds of taxonomies, mimetic characters are mostly found in literature produced within the tradition of ‘realism’. This type of characters are often understood and treated as real human beings since they are self-governing individuals having their own inner lives, drives and motivations; and they often do not follow the scheme of the plot as well as the dictates of the theme. Mimetic characters cannot be studied through structuralists’ theories since they are understood as autonomous persons, and not merely as mechanical and operational tools in the plot. The present study emerges from my hypothesis that the Pakistani novel in English, written by female novelists in particular, is an illustration of realistic literature replete with rich mimetic characters. The characters of the selected five novels have been analyzed through the theoretical lens developed in the Third Force Psychology, and Karen Horney’s theoretical concepts of the interpersonal strategies of defense, intrapsychic pride system, neurotic shoulds, neurotic claims and deals (Bernard Paris’ term for deals is bargains) have been utilized to explore the motivations of characters in the selected novels of Tehmina Durrani, Bapsi Sidhwa and Feryal Ali Gauhar. In addition to presenting a motivational analysis of the mimetic characters of the selected novels, I have also singled out the role of authorial rhetoric which often surrounds the interpretative portrait of characters, keeping in view the notions of interpretation and representation. The study reveals that Pakistani novels in English, written by the selected women writers, present a realistic world of conflicting emotions through their psychologically motivated, rich, complex and independent mimetic characters.

Therefore, there is no mention of instinctual drives or heritability with regard to her three neurotic trends in her 1945 classic book.

Therapists must understand that there is a constant battle in patients between their desire to change and their fear of letting go of the strategies that have enabled them to survive in what they feel to be a dangerous, frustrating, unsympathetic world. They are motivated to change by both a desire to relieve their suffering and the constructive forces that are still alive within them, but they can relinquish their defenses only when they feel safe enough to do so. The therapist’s role is to assuage their anxiety, to reinforce their healthy drives, and to encourage them to continue in their struggle to change. As the central inner conflict rages, patients will oscillate between health and neurosis, but therapists must not become bewildered by these swings.

These include a need for affiliation, a nurturing disposition, a sense of responsibility for other people, and a relational sense of identity. Westkott observed that although these traits are regarded in a positive way, they emerged from “a historical setting in which women are less highly valued than men” (Westkott, 1986, p. 2). She proposed that these traits are defensive reactions to subordination, devaluation, and powerlessness and that, however desirable they may seem from a social point of view, they are inimical to women’s self-actualization. Westkott thus demythified the celebration of female relationality, arguing that is has provided “a contemporary theoretical justification for traditionally idealized femininity” (Westkott, 1989, p. 245).

In support of her position, Horner cites Thomas and Chess (1977), who report "differences of stylistic characteristics in infants," which they refer to as "temperament." "They too speak of \'goodness of fit\' as existing \'when the properties of the environment and its expectations and demands are in accord with the organism\'s own capacities, characteristics, and style of behaving.\'" And they too see poorness of fit as leading "to distorted development and maladaptive functioning" (Horner, 1994, pp. 360-61).')]),a("p",[e._v('Althea Horner\'s "intrinsic self" corresponds closely, I think, to Horney\'s "intrinsic potentialities" (1950, p. 17) that require a favorable environment in which to be actualized.

Horney also posits an "actual self," which is who we really are at any given time. The actual self is a mixture of the strengths and weaknesses, defensive strategies and strivings for health that have been produced by the interaction between our given nature and our environment.

Maslow\'s account of self-actualizing people fleshed out that vision but made me realize how far I was from achieving it. I feared that I could never make it all the way. I became caught, at this point, in what Horney called "the central inner conflict" which develops in the later stages of therapy, after the real self has begun to emerge. Our growing wish to live from our real selves is opposed by our reluctance to be bereft of glory. A violent inner battle ensues, the intensity of which "is commensurate with the basic importance of the issue at stake . . . : does the patient want to keep whatever is left of the grandeur and glamor of his illusions, his claims, and his false pride or can he accept himself as a human being with all the general limitations this implies, and with his special difficulties but also with the possibility of his growth?"

Because of their heightened self-awareness, they are bound to recognize that, notwithstanding their progress, "plenty of old difficulties still persist. And, just because [they have] believed [themselves] to be on the peak, [they strike] out against [themselves] all the harder" (p. 358). The demand that they be perfectly healthy becomes another tyrannical should, and they oscillate between pride and self-hate, as they had done before.')]),a("p",[e._v('If constructive forces are to triumph over pride, patients must achieve an acceptance of themselves not as they want to be or even as they could be but as they are (the "actual self").

They must realize that they "need not necessarily be a unique hero or genius in order to have any self-respect" (Horney, 1950, p. 359).

As a result, we may feel that we are conflicted and need help, and we may "modify our inclinations" so as to conform "to some imagined program or storyline." This is what Horney describes as happening when we incorporate the notion of a unified self into our idealized image and become subject to its tyrannical shoulds. The idea of a real self can then be oppressive indeed and can give rise to a feeling that something is terribly wrong with us even when we are functioning reasonably well.

It pathologizes the "ebbs and flows of desire directed first this way and then that, the ways in which different contexts alter our senses of things" (p. 230). I do not see a necessary conflict between the idea of a real self and Ingram\'s sense of the fluidity of subjectivity. For me, being in touch with my real self means being able to go with the flow, being able to trust myself, not having to drive or scrutinize myself; and I believe that this is what Horney had in mind when she spoke of spontaneity. The real self is not an immutable entity, a homunculus, or a ding an sich, independent of experience. It is initially a set of genetically given potentialities and predispositions, the actualization of which is dependent on the surrounding world. As it evolves throughout life, it is the product of the interactions between the individual\'s intrinsic nature, in Althea Horner\'s terms, and the particular environment in which he or she exists.

I do not think it applies to the real self as Horney conceived it, which is flexible and always in process. When they are functioning in a self-actualizing way, people trust their real self enough to follow its promptings without knowing exactly where they will lead.

At the end of Our Inner Conflicts, she said that the goals of therapy are helping patients to assume responsibility for themselves and to achieve inner independence, spontaneity of feeling, and wholeheartedness. She cautioned, however, that neither the analyst nor the patient is likely wholly to attain these goals. They are ideals to strive for; their practical value lies in their giving us direction in our therapy and in our lives. If we are not clear about the meaning of ideals, we run the danger of replacing an old idealized image with a new one.

Instead of stressing affluence like Potter, Huffman emphasizes the senses of threat and of inferiority that have influenced our national behavior. In its youth the nation was regarded as culturally and socially inferior by the established European powers, and during its expansion, life on the frontier was hazardous. In the cities there was a Darwinian environment, and immigrants, usually poor and oppressed in their homelands, were both discriminated against and perceived as a threat by their new countrymen.')]),a("p",[e._v('These pressures produced compensatory defenses, and, as a result, much of American history reveals a search for glory and an "idealized image of American character. Americans began to believe that the United States would be the greatest nation on earth, then that it was already the greatest nation, and perhaps that it always would be." Because of an inflated sense of our own importance, "we place exaggerated claims on other nations to defer to our wishes, consult us before making any decisions, and treat us like the rulers and peacemakers of the earth" (1982, 31). Like Potter and Wachtel, Huffman observes that "aggressive competition" marks our economic life far "more than cooperation" (35). We like our leaders to be belligerent and glorify people who fight their way to the top. There are other trends in our culture that conflict with the aggressive ones, of course. Huffman proposes to show how Horneyan patterns manifest themselves in popular culture, in politics, in religion and business, and in American history from the revolution to the present. His biographical study of Lyndon Johnson (1989) will become part of his treatment of "Neurosis and the Presidency."')]),a("p",[e._v("There have also been Horneyan analyses of aspects of Elizabethan and Victorian culture (Paris 1991a, 1986).")]),a("p",{staticClass:"cent"},[e._v("Gender")]),a("p",[e._v("As we have seen, Horney has been rediscovered in recent years by feminists, many of whose positions she had anticipated. By and large, those who are interested in feminine psychology or, more broadly, in gender studies have focused on Horney's early essays and have paid little attention to her mature theory, which is not specifically directed to their concerns. The mature theory has important implications, however, for our understanding of gender identity and of masculine and feminine psychology in our culture. Impressive work has been done along these lines by Alexandra Symonds, a Horneyan analyst, and Marcia Westkott, a social psychologist. Horney's mature theory has also been used to address gender issues in popular books by Helen De Rosis and Victoria Pellegrino (1976) and by Claudette Dowling (1981). In this, as in the other areas of application I have discussed, much remains to be done.")]),a("p",[e._v('Alexandra Symonds\' essays are based largely on her clinical experience with women who were suffering from their feminine role, who were trying to escape from that role but finding it difficult, or who seemed to have escaped but were having trouble dealing with the consequences.

Their problems were partly the result of their inability to escape the gender identity prescribed by their culture. They needed to succeed in their careers but also to be nurturers.')]),a("p",[e._v('In "Gender Issues and Horney Theory" (1991), her last essay, Dr. Symonds observes that despite the great changes of the past twenty years, women still have difficulty freeing themselves from compulsive compliance. "In our culture when men are self-effacing it violates their own expectation of what a man should be. They are pleased when as a result of therapy they are able to be more directly assertive, even aggressive. Women do not necessarily welcome this change and each step of the way is much more complicated."

These include a need for affiliation, a nurturing disposition, a sense of responsibility for other people, and a relational sense of identity. Westkott observes that although these traits are regarded in a very positive way, they emerged "from a historical setting in which women are less highly valued than men." "This paradox" suggests "an underside to the nurturance and affilia­tion" that requires exploration (1986, 2). What Westkott finds is that these traits are defensive reactions to subordination, devaluation, and powerlessness and that, however desirable they may seem from a social point of view, they are not good for women\'s self-actualization.')]),a("p",[e._v('Whereas Chodorow argues that women\'s nurturing disposition derives from an extended attachment between mother and daughter that fosters the develop­ment of empathy, Westkott contends that it derives from a "culturally rooted . . . impera­tive" (134) that enjoins females to take care of others, includ­ing their parents. Girls receive less nurturing than boys; they are required to grow up more quickly and to make fewer demands for attention. For West­kott, female altruism "is a contradiction in which the undernurtured nurturer gives what she does not have in order to be \'loved\' by those who have disre­gard or even contempt for her true self and needs" (139-140). The girl is "angry at those who deny her true self," but because of her insecurity she turns her anger against herself, admires the devaluing adults, and tries to gain a sense of safety, worth, and belonging by being what they want her to be. Having been undernurtured themselves, mothers look to their daughters for nurturing, thus perpetuating the demand for female self-sacrifice.')]),a("p",[e._v('In "Female Relationality and the Idealized Self" (1989), Westkott argues that "the self-in-relation is not the authentic self that the Stone Center theorists presume it to be, but the idealized self that Horney associated with self-effacement." The girl develops a set of shoulds that involve "doing for others, caring for them, making their needs the sources of her motives, complying with others\'s demands for recognition." She needs others to validate her idealized image of herself as caring, empathetic, and lovable. The collapse of a relationship or a sense that she has not been caring or sensitive enough makes her feel like her despised self and triggers enormous self-hate. Since she feels angry with herself when she fails to live up to her shoulds and angry with others for having forced her "to repress desires for individual self-fulfillment," the idealized relational self "perpetuates self-criticism and anger as ongoing intrapsychic processes" (247-48).')]),a("p",[e._v('Westkott thus demythifies the celebration of female relationality, arguing that it has provided "a contemporary theoretical justification for traditionally idealized femininity" (245), that is, for self-effacing behavior.

The feminist revolt against the role Western culture has imposed upon women is turning into a reinforcement of that role insofar as women are being told that they need "to \'affili­ate\' with others in order to validate" their "idealized nurturant" selves (1986, 140).')]),a("p",[e._v("Westkott contends that Horney's mature theory is at bottom about the psychology of women, but since it describes me, many men that I know, and a host of male authors, characters, and historical figures, I am convinced that it works as well for men as it does for women and that we have much to learn from it about male as well as female gender issues.")]),a("p",[e._v("1Horneyan studies have been published on the following authors (listed in alphabetical order): Jane Austen (Paris 1978), Honoré de Balzac (Portnoy 1949), Charles Baudelaire (Van Bark 1961), Saul Bellow (Paris 1976b), Emily Brontë (Paris, 1982), Charlotte Brontë (Butery 1986; Paris 1993), Robert Browning (Lewis 1986), Pearl Buck (Vollmerhausen 1950), Joseph Conrad (Paris 1974), Anita Desai (Bande 1988), Charles Dickens (Eldredge 1986), Fyodor Dostoevsky (Van Bark 1961, Paris 1974, 1991c), George Eliot (Paris 1974, 1986; Butery, 1982; Lauer 1985), William Faulkner (Haselswerdt 1986, Butery 1989), Gustave Flaubert (Paris 1981), Robert Frost (Thompson 1966, 1970; Thompson and Winnick 1976; Sheehy 1986), Graham Greene (Straub 1986), Thomas Hardy (Paris 1976a, Butery 1982), Ernest Hemingway (Yalom & Yalom 1971), Henrik Ibsen (Breitbart 1948, Paris 1978a), Henry James (Butery 1982; Lauer 1985), James Joyce (Bartlett 1993), D.

The cultural expectation that women, but not men, must care for others closes men off from their humanity, places a lopsided burden upon women, and makes male-female mutuality impossible (J. B.

According to this interpretation, the self-in-relation finds acceptance from others through displaying the altruistic qualities of "unselfishness, goodness, generosity, humility, saintliness, nobility, sympathy" that she believes will win her love (Horney, 1950, p. 222). These are the shoulds of her defensive system: doing for others, caring for them, making their needs the sources of her motives, complying with others\' demands for recognition. Because her safety lies in appearing empathetic, the self-in-relation needs others to need her as a way of bolstering her self-esteem (Horney, 1937, pp. 109-112). She also needs them to reflect back to her that she is, indeed, her idealized self (Horney, 1945, p. 16). Thus, what Surrey (1987) celebrates as the "motive for connection" (p. 9) is, in effect, a compulsion for confirmation that the self- in-relation is, indeed, empathetic, caring, lovable.

[she] is liked, needed, wanted or loved" (Horney, 1950, p. 227).

Failure to be caring enough or sensitive to others' feelings can incur the wrath of the idealized self-image, fostering a compulsion to live up to the shoulds. Nevertheless, one who is dominated by the idealized self cannot escape its wrath. The combination of defensive perfectionism and inevitable shortcomings serves to make anger against the self a permanent feature of character (Horney, 1951).

However, this elegant definition, expressed linearly, cannot itself provide a basis on which to assign a truth-value to any given hypothesis. To see how a closed system can be opened to the environment, we must step into the next higher dimension, where emotions determine how we react to different kinds of stimuli. The basic emotional responses can be characterized as compliance, fight, and flight. Once we recognize that this three-way branching enables us to transcend linearity in primary consciousness, we can easily see how another branching takes us into secondary consciousness. Then, by comparing the reports from primary and secondary consciousness and storing the results in memory, we can gain access to tertiary consciousness.

Note, however, that the serial system cannot be separated from and is predicated upon the existence of input from the parallel system. Although primary and secondary consciousness cannot be reduced to parallel and serial processing, it should be kept in mind that secondary consciousness depends very heavily on receiving the report of the primary system. Without it, the secondary system may unwittingly fall into serious error.

It is important to pose this question because it demonstrates how the narrative perspectives of screenwriters in television and film plots influence what they bring to viewers’ awareness, and the influence of a search for glory on the depiction of plot and character can be understood in terms of Horneyan theory. This investigation is also important because it will help make Horneyan theory accessible to a broader audience, including non-native users of English. To perform this inquiry, I will use Bernard J. Paris’s literary-analytic concept of the “implied author” to infer from which character’s point of view the events of the soap opera are being presented, what kind of search for glory she is on, and how this helps us understand plot manipulations and their relation to the implied screenwriter’s rhetorical stance and to viewer response. In addition, to update Horneyan theory and reinforce it by connection with recent scientific evidence, I will show that its principles are corroborated by the latest findings in dream research and brain science (e.g., Hobson, 1999; Friston & Hobson, 2012, 2014).")])])],1)],1)],1),a("Footer")],1)},Eo=[],Ro={name:"e13",components:{Footer:J}},Ko=Ro,Lo=(a("f7a2"),Object(c["a"])(Ko,zo,Eo,!1,null,"0a3cd9e6",null)),jo=Lo.exports;f()(Lo,{VCardText:R["a"],VCardTitle:K["a"],VContainer:U["a"],VFlex:L["a"],VLayout:q["a"]});var qo=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",[a("v-container",[a("v-layout",[a("v-flex",{staticClass:"text",attrs:{xs12:""}},[a("v-card-title",{staticClass:"titl"},[e._v("A Horn-eye View of Castaway on the Moon (2009): Alienation from Self, and Emotional Capsules")]),a("v-card-text",{staticClass:"cont"},[e._v("By Anthony K.

To counteract feelings of anxiety and inadequacy, Americans developed an idealized image of American character and engaged in a search for glory. Many people of the United States began to believe that theirs would be the greatest nation on earth. Soon they believed that it was the greatest and always would be.

But goals which are unreasonable can lead to overachievement and obsession rather than healthy accomplishment. American emphasis on freedom is also basically healthy, though again it can serve unhealthy tendencies. Freedom should be an empowerment of persons, not an occasion to exercise control over others or to avoid connection and commitment.

Similarly, although some forms of feminism seem unhealthy in glorifying the virtues of the self-effacing or in trying to make women expansive like men, others support healthy self-assertion and self-actualization. Close study of Abraham Maslow\'s hierarchy of human needs reveals that many Americans suffer from lack of security and fulfillment even of "lower" needs. Nevertheless, many Americans certainly move toward self-actualization, and have difficulties more in trying to achieve "higher" needs such as love and belonging than in achieving safety and material comfort.')]),a("p",[e._v("Even much maligned popular culture, with its very clearly expansive embrace of violence, reveals healthy trends.

The Muppets generally seem to reflect healthy psychology also, and programs like Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood help build good self-esteem in children. The United States is obviously neither completely healthy nor totally sick. But Americans need to recognize and admit which is which.

To evaluate Daly's pathological diagnosis and resolution to it, I turn to Karen Horney. There is much in Horney that affirms Daly's description: the patriarchal male as aggressive-vindictive; the patriarchal female as compliant and morbidly dependent. Interestingly enough, Daly's liberated woman resembles Horney's detached-resigned neurotic type, suggesting more pathology where liberation is thought to lie. The resolution might be found in Horney's belief that self-hate--a refusal to be who one actually is--is at the root of pathology, patriarchal or otherwise.
